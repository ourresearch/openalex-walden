In this paper we study the asymptotic expansions of the squared L 2 -norms of u ( t , x ) , u ˆ ( t , ξ ) − ν ( t , ξ ) , and ν ( t , ξ ) as t → ∞ . With suitable initial data u ( 0 , x ) and u t ( 0 , x ) , we establish the rate of decay of the squared L 2 -norms of u ( t , x ) and ν ( t , ξ ) as t → ∞ . By noting the cancellation of leading terms of their respective expansions, we conclude that the rate of convergence between u ˆ ( t , ξ ) and ν ( t , ξ ) in the L 2 -norm occurs quickly relative to their individual behaviors. This observation is similar to the diffusion phenomenon, which has been well studied."}

We derive and discuss the dispersion relations for charge-density excitations within the framework of Bohm-Pines' random-phase approximation. The magnetoplasmons in a 2DEG are known to be characterized by two important properties: (i) the oscillatory behavior of the dispersion curves in the short wavelength limit (SWL) and (ii) the resonance splitting at the frequency $\\ensuremath{\\omega}=n{\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$ in the long wavelength limit (LWL); $n\\phantom{\\rule{0.2em}{0ex}}(\\ensuremath{\\geqslant}2)$ being an integer and ${\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$ the cyclotron frequency. Here we study the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) on these characteristics in depth. We observe that the SOI modifies drastically both the oscillatory behavior in the SWL and yields multiple resonance splittings [at $\\ensuremath{\\omega}=(n\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}{x}_{0}){\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$] in the LWL. Such resonance splittings make the spintronic systems potential candidates for quantum-well-based new devices as spin filters.

A Python-based controller is used to manage the state of charge (SoC) of the lithium-ion battery. Two buildings are considered in the study. Once the SoC in the first building reaches 75 %, the system prevents overcharging and redirects the green electricity towards the hybrid system for hydrogen production . To compare the role of a hybrid system in which a fuel cell is used to supply the required energy for electric load and electrolyzer demand, a diesel generator is considered for the same energy demands. The hybrid system achieves a 56.14 % reduction in diesel fuel consumption, leading to an annual decrease of 33.860 tons of CO 2 emissions. Economic analysis reveals that while the cost of the diesel mode is calculated to be 96 % higher than the hybrid mode, the CO 2 emissions in the hybrid mode will be 56.14 % lower than the full diesel mode. Additionally, the system's total annual hydrogen production is 7582.74 kg, with a maximum production rate of 15.52 m³/hr at 1.3 bar pressure. Despite higher initial costs, hybrid systems effectively address the challenge of CO 2 emissions compared to conventional systems. The results underscore the necessity of hybrid systems for achieving significant reductions in fossil fuel consumption, presenting a sustainable solution for future energy needs. • To employ a smart energy management system for near-zero energy buildings. • To conduct transient analyses of solar and wind energy for hydrogen production. • To compare the environmental impact of two different energy systems. • To analyze the integration of electrochemical and chemical energy storage systems."}

Results showed that the fiber laser was feasible for cutting CFRP with very high efficiency. The HAZ level of laser cutting CFRP was highly related to fiber orientation, laser power, and cutting speed based on theoretical and statistical analysis. Thermal model was built to simulate HAZ values recorded on the exit surface. The calculated results were close (within ~ 60 μm) to the experimental results. The lowest HAZ value of 707 μm and surface roughness of 2.43-μm surface roughness were achieved in cutting Type 1 (+ 45°/− 45°) configuration.

Generally, in the wave field calculation, it starts with a large region formulation first and follows by a separated detailed region formulation by more denser grids for the main interest area considering the geographical and bathymetrical variation. The wave fields resulted from the large region calculation is being introduced into the detail region calculation as the incident waves. In this process there exists a problem of continuity. In order to get over such problem, method of variable gridding system or spectrum sampling, etc., is being used. However, it seems not enough to examine and analyze the related numerical errors. Therefore, it is investigated in this study the field applicability of the most pervasive use of wave model, the nested SWAN model. For this purpose, we made model experiment for two coastal harbours with different tidal environment, and compared and analyzed the result. From the analysis, it was found that both the extracted values, near the boundaries of the large and detail region and the nested formulation of SWAN model, show almost the same and no different between those with different tidal environment conditions. However it is necessary for reducing the numerical errors to set the boundaries for the detailed region outside of the rapid bathymetric change and deeper region."}

The results indicate a consistent increase in critical bandwidth with level of the two masking tones (approximately 3%/dB). Irregularities in the individual two-tone masking functions led to further investigations with a single listener. For subcritical frequency separations between masking tones, -10 dB/decade masking slopes were demonstrated along with large dips or notches in the two-tone masking functions. Both the -10 dB/decade masking slopes and the large notches were replicated in detail when only the lower-frequency tones of the two-tone masking pairs were employed as maskers. Separate masking bands were then introduced that eliminated the -10 dB/decade masking slope and the large notch. It is concluded that the two-tone masking experiment is really a single-tone experiment, and that the detection of beats, roughness, and combination tones determines the form of single-tone and two-tone masking functions. If critical bandwidth estimates are to be obtained from these experiments, it is most appropriate to refer to those estimates as ‘critical bandwidths for tonal interaction’.Etudiant chez cinq personnes à audition normale l'effet de masque produit par deux sons sur un signal de 1 000 Hz, nous avons pu observer, en augmentant le niveau des deux sons masquants, un accroissement consécutif de la largeur de la bande critique (environ 3%/dB).Des irrégularités dans les fonctions individuelles de masque par les deux sons nous ont conduit à poursuivre nos observations sur seulement un sujet. Utilisant des séparations fréquentielles sub-critiques entre les sons masquants, nous avons noté dans les fonctions de masque par les deux sons, d'une part une pente de -10 dB/décade et d'autre part d'importantes encoches; nous avons fait la měme observation avec comme masque seulement les sons inférieurs. Des bandes de masque séparées furent alors ajoutées et la pente de -10 dB/décade ainsi que les grandes encoches disparurent.En conclusion, nous pensons que les expériences de masque par deux sons sont en réalité des expériences par un seul son, et que la détection des battements, de la rugosité et des sons combines détermine la forme des fonctions de masque par un son et par deux sons. Si ces expériences doivent nous donner une estimation de la largeur de la bande critique, il nous paraiˇt plus logique de parler à leur propos d'estimation de la largeur des bandes critiques sans interaction tonale."}

Despite homologous structures and essentially identical iron binding sites, Tf begins to release iron at pH 6.0, whereas Lf retains iron to pH ∼3.5. This difference in iron retention gives the two proteins different biological roles. Two lysine residues, Lys 206 and Lys 296, which form a hydrogen-bonded dilysine pair in human Tf, have been shown to strongly influence iron release from the N-lobe. The equivalent residues in human Lf are Arg 210 and Lys 301, and we have here mutated Arg 210 in the N-lobe half-molecule of human lactoferrin, LfN, to probe its role in iron release. The LfN mutants R210G, R210E, and R210L were expressed, purified, and crystallized, and their crystal structures were determined and refined at resolutions of 1.95 Å (R210G), 2.2 Å (R210E), and 2.0 Å (R210L). The overall structures are very similar to that of wild-type LfN, but with small differences in domain orientations. In each of the mutants, however, Lys 301 (equivalent to Lys 296 in Tf) changes its conformation to fill the space occupied by Arg 210 Nη2 in wild-type LfN, interacting with the two tyrosine ligands Tyr 92 and Tyr 192. By comparison with other Lf and Tf structures, we conclude that Lys 301 (or Lys 296 in Tf) only occupies this site when residue 210 (206 in Tf) is nonpositive (neutral as in R210G and R210L or negative as in R210E). Thus, Lys 206 in the Tf dilysine pair is identified as having a depressed pKa. Three specific sites are variably occupied by polar groups in the Lf mutants and other Lf and Tf proteins, and when coupled with iron-release data, these give new insights into the factors that most influence iron retention at low pH."}

Second, recent research on shared mobility is reviewed from the perspective of smart use of cars. Third, existing studies on cars from the life-oriented consideration are described by looking at shopping behavior (both store-shopping and online shopping) and general purchasing behavior as well as electric vehicle ownership and usage. As for electric vehicles, the influence of lifestyle is explored. Fourth, car ownership and usage for an inclusive society are discussed, where low-income persons, children, and the elderly are focused on. Fifth, behavioral changes toward less dependence on car from a long-term perspective are illustrated. Finally, discussions on car dependence from the life-oriented perspective are given."}

Technically, an online MALL questionnaire adapted from Uzunboylu and Ozdamli [1] with 26 items was distributed to the respondents. After that, the data were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics with a statistical program. The findings revealed positive perceptions of pre-service EFL teachers on using MALL in teaching practicum (M = 3 and above). The capacity of mobile learning apps to enhance traditional education and facilitate teacher-student collaboration through mobile learning tools received the highest praise. On the contrary, the t-test results presented no significant differences between males’ and females’ perceptions of the use of MALL during teaching practicum (ρ = 0.050 = 0.05). Hence, both male and female pre-service EFL teachers agreed that MALL is suitable for language teaching, and both groups also perceived that MALL could accommodate their teaching practice."}

Existem dados evolutivos, anatômicos e neuroendócrinos em favor desta afirmação. OBJETIVOS: Verificar a medida do comprimento do intestino delgado em pacientes obesos submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica e analisar a correlação entre o seu tamanho e o IMC. MÉTODO: A casuística foi composta de 30 pacientes do Serviço de Obesidade do Hospital Universitário Evangélico de Curitiba, submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica no período de março a junho de 2009, e previamente avaliados, verificando peso, altura e IMC. A técnica cirúrgica foi a de Fobi-Capella. A mensuração do intestino delgado foi realizada desde a flexura duodenojejunal à junção ileocecal, durante o trans-operatório, utilizando uma pinça de manipulação intestinal, a qual foi marcada com a medida de 10 cm. As alças intestinais foram medidas na margem anti-mesentérica, aplicando-se tensão mínima necessária para retificar as mesmas. Os dados foram correlacionados e tabulados estatisticamente, utilizando-se o método de correlação de Pearson. RESULTADOS: A média do comprimento intestinal para o sexo masculino foi de 582,5 cm e para o sexo feminino de 509,1. A partir do cálculo do coeficiente de correlação de Pearson, confirmou-se a ausência de correlação entre IMC e comprimento do intestino delgado. CONCLUSÃO: Obteve-se uma média de tamanho intestinal de 528,7 cm para toda a amostra. O comprimento do intestino delgado não possuiu correspondência com o IMC, não sendo um fator de significância neste estudo."}

His objective was in the first instance Ancyra. His general, Afshin, in command of what we may call the Eastern army, crossed the Taurus by the pass of Hadath (Adata), and presumably his route was by Arabissos, Tzamandos, and Sebastea. The two divisions of the Western army, under the Caliph himself and Ashnas, started from Cilicia and crossed by the Cilician gates."}

With the advancement of knowledge about the biological behavior of these materials when implanted in living tissue, a great search for morphological changes at macrogeometric, microgeometric and even nanogeometric levels was started, to accelerate the process of osseointegration of implants, reducing the time for the rehabilitation treatment. This chapter will seek to demonstrate, through scientific evidence, the potential effect of the morphological characteristics of implants on osseointegration. Modifications in the surface treatment of implants will be discussed to improve the osseointegration process in terms of quality and time reduction, changes in the surgical technique used for the osteotomy of the implant installation site, and macrogeometric changes in the shape of the implant body."}

COMPTON", "affiliations": [""], "is_corresponding": false}], "abstract": "A biochemical hallmark of cells undergoing programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is the endonucleolytic cleavage of genomic DNA at internucleosomal sites. To study further the nuclease involved in this process, an assay system was developed to measure internucleosomal DNA degradation. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase), a bacterial enzyme that cleaves chromatin at internucleosomal intervals, was used to validate the assay procedure. Thymocyte nuclear proteins obtained from glucocorticoid-treated chickens, a source of internucleosomal DNA-degrading activity, were incubated with chicken red blood cell nuclei, and genomic DNA was subsequently extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Generation of internucleosomal DNA degradation products by the thymocyte protein extract required ATP and was both time and protein concentration dependent. This nuclease activity could be inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, alkylating agents, or heat denaturation. Addition of purified proteinases, RNases, or other types of nucleases to the assay failed to generate discrete internucleosomal lengths of DNA, thus confirming the nuclease specificity of this assay. On the basis of these data, we believe that this assay system will be instrumental in isolating and characterizing the nuclease(s) associated with apoptosis."}

The Halstead-Reitan Battery was used to measure psychological and behavioral functions of children. The mean finger-tapping time (left hand) was significantly lower for children with than without VSD (P < 0.05). For non-handedness tactual performance, the mean time was significantly longer for surgery than interventional therapy groups and controls (P < 0.05). The number of remembered locations was significantly lower for surgery than interventional therapy groups and controls (P < 0.05). The correct number of music rhythms was significantly lower for the surgery than control group (P < 0.05). Children with and without VSD did not differ in the correct number of first-group music rhythms. Nevertheless, for second- and third-group music rhythms, the correct number was significantly lower for the surgery than interventional therapy groups and controls (P < 0.05). The correct number of third-group music rhythms was significantly lower for only the interventional therapy than control group. School-aged children with VSD had normal IQ levels after surgery or interventional therapy but decreased fine-motor and auditory discrimination abilities as well as visual spatial disorder. Children with and without VSD did not differ in general tasks, but abilities on more complex and difficult tasks were lower for children with VSD. Impairments were greater after surgery than interventional therapy."}

At the same time, students who are presenting their experiences gain additional perspective by listening to feedback given by the class and having the opportunity to think in retrospect about how they dealt with the incident.

In the study of geological disasters, analyses of the causes of disasters, case studies, and research on monitoring and early warning have been summarized. This event clearly demonstrates a continuous process from meteorological events to hydrological impacts, and then to geological disasters, forming a distinct \"meteorological-hydrological-geological disaster\" chain. Due to the increasing impact of climate change and human activities on extreme rainfall events, future research should delve deeper into the roles of these factors in floods and geological disasters, strengthen flood disaster management, and enhance geological disaster early warning systems.

The availability of a defined medium is a prerequisite for a rational process development and the investigation of medium effects on final product concentration, yield, and volumetric productivity. We identified four vitamins and three metal ions as essential for growth and PGDM production with S. gallinarum ΔP. The strain was capable of growing without any added amino acids, but the addition of proline had a strong growth-stimulatory effect. The concentrations of all essential compounds were balanced in a continuous culture using a medium-shift technique. Based on this balanced medium, a fed-batch process was developed in which S. gallinarum ΔP was grown up to a biomass concentration of 67 g l−1 and produced 1.95 g l−1 PGDM, equivalent to 0.57 mM. In the fermentation broth, we identified other GDM precursors in addition to those with a 12 or 14-amino-acid-long leader peptide that had been observed previously. Including those precursors with shorter leader sequences, the final concentration would correspond to 0.69 mM. In molar terms, this represents a roughly fourfold or fivefold increase, respectively, over established, complex medium-based gallidermin production processes (Kempf et al. 2000). With the same medium and feed protocol, the maximum concentration of mature GDM produced by wild-type S. gallinarum Tü 3928 was only 0.08 mM."}

Although there was some overlapping of species, multivariate analysis using cluster analysis for classification and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for ordination, showed that there were significant differences between the five gears in terms of species composition and biomasses discarded, with the least similarity between crustacean trawling and all other fishing operations. The differences between fisheries were probably as a result of a combination of gear selectivity and depth fished.

In contrast, AI-driven approaches have transformed this landscape by offering faster, scalable, and more efficient solutions. These methods can leverage diverse types of input data—such as protein sequences (text inputs) or three-dimensional structural information (structure inputs)—to model complex molecular interactions with remarkable accuracy, often comparable to or surpassing traditional methods.

We show that the image of a Kac-Moody Lie bialgebra with the standard quasitriangular structure under the quantization functor defined in QLB-I,II is isomorphic to the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantization of this Lie bialgebra, with the standard quasitriangular structure. This implies that when the quantization parameter is formal, then the category O for the quantized Kac-Moody algebra is equivalent, as a braided tensor category, to the category O over the corresponding classical Kac-Moody algebra, with the tensor category structure defined by a Drinfeld associator. This equivalence is a generalization of the functor constructed previously by G. Lusztig and the second author. In particular, we answer positively a question of Drinfeld whether the characters of irreducible highest weight modules for quantized Kac-Moody algebras are the same as in the classical case. Moreover, our results are valid for the Lie algebra \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                  $\\mathfrak{g}(A)$\n                 corresponding to any symmetrizable matrix A (not necessarily with integer entries), which answers another question of Drinfeld.

The specific objectives were to identify socio-economic characteristics of farm households; and determine the degree of their vulnerability to desertification. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 633 respondents from 18 rural communities across six Local Government Areas (LGAs). Data from 21 indicators for the three components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) were used to measure the degree of vulnerability and thus, classify households into less, moderate and highly vulnerable. The study found that households in Jibia LGA were less vulnerable, with a VI of 1.228, while Kaita, Mashi, and Mai'adua LGAs were moderately vulnerable with VI of 0.523, 0.756, and 0.685, respectively. Households in Zango and Baure LGAs were found to be highly vulnerable due to poor biophysical conditions, with indices of 1.629 and -1.405, respectively. Furthermore, while 49% of the total households sampled were moderately vulnerable to desertification, 30% were less vulnerable and 21% were found to be highly vulnerable. As a result, the study recommended that the need for vegetative cover regeneration, soil quality rehabilitation, increased irrigation use, and biomass stability that take into account the vagaries of climate be prioritized in order to support, rescue, and increase the resilience of vulnerable households.\r\nKeywords: Adaptation; Desertification; Dry lands; Farm Households; Vulnerability Index"}

One cannot make sense of South Africa’s political history without looking into the role of social movements and, at the same time, you cannot make sense of the current social movements in South Africa without understanding the country’s history. Social movements are a communicative practice that the marginalised have used and still use to speak back to systems of oppression. They exist to challenge the status quo and bring social change. However, social movements would not exist without communication. Networks are built through communication, mobilisation can only take place through communication, the ideologies of a movement are transferred through communication and the movement itself would not be able to challenge the status quo without communicating. It is, therefore, important to investigate how social movements communicate and the role of their sustained interactions in bringing social change. This chapter looks at the communication practices of two social movements: Abahlali baseFreedom Park, which is a community movement of the poor, and the Wits Fees must fall movement which involved students in a previously white university. The chapter critically reflects on the social positioning of these two movements and how it affects the way in which the activists of these movements communicate(d). It further explores how this may have had an impact on their efforts or hopes to bring socio-economic and political transformation in South Africa. The country’s political history and current economic state is considered in the process of understanding the communication practices of the two movements."}

To this end, two types of semester-long, explicit phonetic instruction training are compared: High Phonetic Variability Training (HPVT) with exposure to multiple sources of speech, and regular standalone phonetics courses with low variability of speech input (LPVT). Data from two identical pre-test and post-test ABX perceptual discrimination tasks were obtained from 27 students, as well as 7 control speakers whose primary language is Spanish. Results show that heritage learners perceive the contrast better than L2 learners, and that HPVT significantly improves the perception of the /e/-/ei/ contrast. Although heritage learners perform close to a native ceiling and do not significantly differ from native controls, the improvement from pre-test to post-test is larger in heritage learners enrolled in HPVT than LPVT training. These results suggest that, although the discrimination accuracy of Spanish /e/ and /ei/ is already high for heritage learners at the pre-test stage, High Phonetic Variability Training can be beneficial in the perceptual development of their heritage language, even matching their accuracy to that of native speakers."}

However, whether aging influences the development or extent of the autonomic imbalance in HF remains unclear. To address this, we used an ovine model of aging with tachypacing-induced HF to determine whether aging affects the chronotropic and inotropic responses to autonomic stimulation and reduction in heart rate variability (HRV) in HF. We find that aging is associated with increased cardiac dimensions and reduced contractility before the onset of tachypacing, and these differences persist in HF. Additionally, the chronotropic response to β-adrenergic stimulation was markedly attenuated in HF, and this occurred more rapidly in aged animals. By measuring HR during sequential autonomic blockade, our data are consistent with a reduced parasympathetic control of resting HR in aging, with young HF animals having an attenuated sympathetic influence on HR. Time-domain analyses of HR show a reduction in HRV in both young and aged failing animals, although HRV is lowest in aged HF. In conclusion, aging is associated with altered autonomic control and β-adrenergic responsiveness of HR, and these are exacerbated with the development of HF."}

Their dynamics are strongly modulated by thermal stratification and surface meteorological forcing. This study examines the influence of interannual meteorological variability from 1980 to 2010 on internal wave behavior using a series of numerical simulations in Lake Biwa in Japan. In each simulation, air temperature, wind speed, or precipitation was perturbed by ±2 standard deviations relative to the climatological mean. Power spectral analysis of simulated velocity fields was conducted for the surface, thermocline, and bottom layers, focusing on super-inertial (6–16 h), near-inertial (~16–30 h), and sub-inertial (>30 h) frequency bands. The results show that higher air temperatures intensify stratification and enhance near-inertial internal waves, particularly within the thermocline, whereas cooler conditions favor sub-inertial wave dominance. Increased wind speeds amplify internal wave energy across all layers, with the strongest effect occurring in the high-frequency band due to intensified wind stress and vertical shear, while weaker winds suppress wave activity. Precipitation variability primarily affects surface stratification, exerting more localized and weaker impacts. These findings highlight the non-linear, depth-dependent responses of internal waves to atmospheric drivers and improve understanding of the coupling between climate variability and internal wave energetics. The insights gained provide a basis for more accurate predictions and sustainable management of stratified aquatic ecosystems under future climate scenarios."}

Isosteviol, a natural bioactive molecule, has been reported to possess an anticonvulsant property. In this work, we first reported a series of C-15 fluoro isosteviol analogs which are bearing different functional groups at C-16 to investigate the interactions with GABA-AT by applying molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation approach. The results revealed that all fluoro isosteviol analogs displayed a greater binding affinity than references vigabatrin, an FDA-approved GABA-AT inactivator, and CPP-115, which has Orphan Drug Designation status, and positioned at the same binding site as references. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies on minimum (A1), maximum (E1) binding energy score of fluoro isosteviol analogs, and isosteviol (G1) revealed their stable complex formation in terms of RMSD, RMSF, RG, and hydrogen bond formation. All analogs were found to have drug-like nature, non-toxic, >80% absorption, and the majority tend to penetrate brain-blood-barrier (BBB). The investigations found in this study can help in the development of isosteviol derivatives as drugs for the treatment of epilepsy. The two-dimensional (2D) ligand structures were drawn using ChembioDraw Ultra 14.0. Molecular docking with Autodock4 and molecular dynamic simulation with GROMACS version 2020.1 were performed. The CHARMM27 all-atom force field was applied for writing the topology. Biovia Discovery Studio DS2021 was used for viewing and analyzing the protein-ligand complexes. The data generated from molecular dynamic simulation trajectories were plotted using the Origin® 8 software. The Open Babel software was utilized for extracting SMILEs files of all the fluoro isosteviol analogs. The drug-likeness and ADMET of the molecules were evaluated by SwissADME and ADMETlab 2.0 web tools."}

Pharmacological interventions targeting mitochondria may be effective for developing agents against cardiotoxicity. Herein, in triptolide-treated H9C2 cardiomyocytes, we observed defective mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, characterized by depletion of mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial DNA copy number, downregulation of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes subunits, and disorders of mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation . Dysregulation of mitochondria led to cardiac pathological features, such as myocardial fiber fracture, intercellular space enlargement, and elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase , creatine kinase isoenzyme , lactate dehydrogenase , and cardiac troponin I. However, following calycosin treatment, an active compound from Astragali Radix , the mitochondrion-related disorders at both cell and tissue levels were significantly ameliorated, which was facilitated by the activation of PGC-1α via deacetylation , followed by NRF1 co-activation. Calycosin-enhanced PGC-1α deacetylation is impelled by increasing sirtuin-1 expression and NAD + /NADH ratio. PGC-1α/NRF1 signaling in calycosin-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis protection was further confirmed by NRF1 knockdown and PGC-1α inhibition with SR18292. We conclude that calycosin ameliorated triptolide-induced cardiotoxicity by protecting PGC-1α/NRF1-dependent cardiac mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, which is the druggable pathway for cardiotoxicity mitigation. • Calycosin ameliorated triptolide-induced cardiotoxicity by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis in vivo and in vitro. • PGC-1α/NRF1 signalling activation is mechanistically involved in calycosin-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis protection. • PGC-1α deacetylation that is impelled by sirtuin-1 is indispensable for calycosin promoting mitochondrial biogenesis."}

The impact of such diversification on metastatic potential is unknown. Here we identify clonal human breast cancer subpopulations that display different levels of morphological and molecular diversity. Highly variable subpopulations are more proficient at metastatic colonization and chemotherapeutic survival. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, inter-cell transcript expression variability is identified as a defining feature of the highly variable subpopulations that leads to protein-level variation. Furthermore, we identify high variability in the spliceosomal machinery gene set. Engineered variable expression of the spliceosomal gene SNRNP40 promotes metastasis, attributable to cells with low expression. Clinically, low SNRNP40 expression is associated with metastatic relapse. Our findings reveal transcriptomic variability generation as a mechanism by which cancer subpopulations can diversify gene expression states, which may allow for enhanced fitness under changing environmental pressures encountered during cancer progression. Phenotypic and genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity have an important role in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance.

Of these, aggregates and placers are shallow water deposits and have been mined for several decades and whose extraction poses few technological difficulties other than those associated with mining in progressively deeper or more hostile environments. Phosphorites are mid-depth deposits, generally not more than a few hundred metres deep, which have yet to be mined offshore. Prospective deposits such as those on Chatham Rise off New Zealand are coarse gravels 0.8–5.0 cm in size. Proposed mining techniques involve a hydraulic lift system incorporating various separators, as yet still at the drawing board stage. Black smoker deposits are composed principally of Cu, Zn and Fe bearing sulphide minerals which precipitate from hydrothermal solutions discharging at high temperature onto the ocean floor. Most occurrences are at mid-ocean ridge crests at around 3500 m depth, but they also occur in island arcs, sometimes at shallower depth. The nature of the deposits depends on many factors including their temperature of formation, substrate rock composition and rock-water reactions taking place below the sea floor. Resource feasibility studies on these deposits have only been carried out in the Red Sea where in the 60 km2 Atlantis II Deep there are 30 million tonnes (m.t.) of Fe, 2 m.t. of Zn and 0.5 m.t. of Cu, together with significant amounts of silver. A pre-pilot test mining operation has been carried out there. Manganese nodules are mainly non-EEZ deposits being concentrated in the proposed future International Seabed Area (ISA) of UNCLOS, more than 200 miles from land. However, important nodule deposits occur within the EEZ’s of some Pacific island nations such as the Cook Islands and on the Blake Plateau in the United States EEZ, which might be mined preferentially to the ISA ones. The largest deposits are rich in Co rather than in Ni and Cu, the two most economically important metals in the ISA. Cobalt-rich manganese crusts have been known for almost as long as the nodules, but have only recently been thought of as an economic deposit. They are attached to hard rock substrates mainly on seamounts between 800–2400 m depth and pose considerable mining problems in that, unlike nodules, they would have to be broken off before recovery. Average Co in the deposits is around 1%, but recovered ore will contain less Co than this due to dilution by substrate material and may be no richer in Co than the 0.5% Co typical of the Co-rich nodules mentioned above. Recent resource assessments for Co in both nodules and crusts in the EEZ’s of the Cook Islands and parts of Kiribati have shown much greater quantities of Co in the nodules than in the crusts, suggesting that the relative resource potentials of these deposits in EEZ’s needs to be reassessed."}

As a primary trial seeking to reshape the destiny of silk wastes, the present study is focused on transforming natural silk nonwovens, as a typical model of artificial silk nonwovens, into bioadhesives for tissue repair. Herein, a technique is demonstrated for the preparation of a transparent and stretchable adhesive from a silkworm cocoon sheet (SCS), a typical natural silk nonwoven. This technique differs from the traditional method of completely dissolving silk fibers to obtain silk fibroin. Specifically, the technique entailed pretreatment of the SCS with a CaCl 2 -ethanol-H 2 O ternary solution to obtain a modified cocoon sheet (MCS), followed by surface modification with a CaCl 2 -formic acid (Ca-FA) solution to obtain MCS@Ca with controllable adhesion, which was achieved by adjusting the Ca 2+ content in Ca-FA. The highly stretchable MCS@Ca firmly adhered to various substrates for loads as high as 54 kPa, and its performance in repairing an injured liver in vivo was superior to that of a commercial product, Sorbalgon®. Additionally, MCS@Ca effectively sealed a freshly punctured porcine heart and stomach ex vivo , thereby demonstrating its potential as a sealant. To our knowledge, this is the first trial study for on upcycling disqualified silk fibers using a convenient top-down approach to prepare robust bioadhesives for tissue repair, wherein MCS@Ca may serve to bridge the gap between advanced biomaterials and disqualified silk wastes. • Silk wastes upcycled into stretchable bioadhesives (MCS@Ca) via a top-down approach. • Adhesion was controllable by adjusting the Ca 2+ content during surface modification. • MCS@Ca was superior in repairing an injured liver in vivo compared with Sorbalgon®. • MCS@Ca also served as effective sealant for a punctured heart and stomach ex vivo ."}

This co-relationship of ED50 values for stimulus generalization decreasing with reduction in training dose was in contrast to the time-course of the two groups when tested from 15 to 240 min post-injection; this experimentation indicated that there was a non-significant difference in half-life for the 2.0 mg/kg (t1/2: 97.1 min) vs. that of the 10.0 mg/kg cocaine-trained group (t1/2: 83.4 min). Generalization tests with other purportedly dopaminergically-active drugs of abuse including 0.05–0.8 mg/kg d-amphetamine, 0.125–1.5 mg/kg methamphetamine and 0.125–1.0 mg/kg methcathinone indicated that the highest doses of each produced generalization and, with the exception of methcathinone, the ED50 values were significantly lower in the low-cocaine trained group. The stimulus properties of cocaine, as they generalize to amphetamine, methampetamine and methcathinone, can be explained by effects upon central dopaminergic neurons and may be qualitatively different in low- and high-dose trained rats."}

Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelium activation and, followed by a cascade of events (accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and calcification), triggers the vessel narrowing and activation of inflammatory pathways. The resultant atheroma plaque, along with these processes, results in cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the different stages of atherosclerosis development, ranging from endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture. In addition, the post-transcriptional regulation and modulation of atheroma plaque by microRNAs and lncRNAs, the role of microbiota, and the importance of sex as a crucial risk factor in atherosclerosis are covered here in order to provide a global view of the disease."}

Most of the chemical variation was observed within populations (83.7%). With microsatellites, the variation between populations was more pronounced (32% of the total variation). Although the chemical variation between populations was small, we investigated the effects of genetic drift and migration by comparing the chemical- and molecular-differentiation patterns. The poor congruence between neighbor-joining trees, confirmed by the non-significant Mantel test between the molecular and chemical distance matrices (R=0.26, P=0.12), showed that genetic drift and migration are not the main evolutionary forces acting on chemical differentiation between populations. We could not find any effect of soil and rainfall conditions neither.\nAlthough the impact of drift and migration cannot be discounted in rationalizing between-population differentiation, the low variation among populations could result from a stabilizing selection caused by the same phytopathogen charge across the natural range."}

Indeed, the planning and establishment of Green and Blue Infrastructure (GBI) are being increasingly adopted as an appropriate approach worldwide. For example, the GBI plans in the United States, Portugal, and China was successfully developed and adopted as an ideal reference for many researchers. It is an ecological network that is planned to offer a range of ecological, economic, and social benefits. Particularly, it provides opportunities for human well-being, such as recreation, education, aesthetics, culture, etc. It contributes strongly to the improvement of the living environment of the population, ensures better connectivity of spaces, and safeguards fauna and flora biodiversity. The main objective of this research is to maintain and enhance ecological connectivity in a Tunisian region located in the Sahel, Enfidha. The methodology developed focuses on habitat composition and ecosystem connectivity to determine the structural connectivity of linear and spatial habitats taking place in the study area. It comprises three steps. In the first step, the spatial arrangement of landscape features was studied. It identifies landscape diversity and characterizes habitat composition from the land use map (2017). Then, the core areas were identified corresponding to the representative species living in these environments. In the third step, ecological corridors were highlighted as large-scale linkages showing areas where species can move freely. Three different landscape ecosystems have been identified: forest ecosystem, semi-natural rangeland ecosystem and wetland ecosystem. The GBI map is created by merging landscapes’ ecosystems with core areas and ecological corridors. It represents a key solution to reduce habitat fragmentation and promote biodiversity conservation in the Enfidha region. Steps presented to elaborate on this GBI can be considered a reference to decision-makers and stakeholders in their future territorial projects in terms of sustainable development."}

The Late Heavy Bombardment was a period of time, generally put at about 4.1 billion to 3.8 billion years ago, when the inner planets of the Solar System were subjected to a high-frequency barrage of asteroids. This left its mark on the Moon, but on Earth the craters quickly disappeared owing to tectonic processes and erosion. In the first of two papers on the bombardment, Brandon Johnson and Jay Melosh determine the properties of the asteroids by looking at spherule beds: layers of debris ejected during the impacts. The thickness of spherule layers is expected to vary according to the size of the impactor and the speed at which it hit Earth. This historical record of impacts indicates that the number of projectiles colliding with Earth was substantially higher 3.5 billion years ago than it is today, with a gradual decline in the number of strikes after the Late Heavy Bombardment. Bottke et al. modelled the evolution of an asteroid belt that extended farther towards Mars than the present one. They find that most of the impactors traced by the spherule beds probably originated in this 'E-belt', which was disrupted during migrations of some of the giant planets. The barrage of comets and asteroids that produced many young lunar basins (craters over 300 kilometres in diameter) has frequently been called the Late Heavy Bombardment1 (LHB). Many assume the LHB ended about 3.7 to 3.8 billion years (Gyr) ago with the formation of Orientale basin2,3. Evidence for LHB-sized blasts on Earth, however, extend into the Archaean and early Proterozoic eons, in the form of impact spherule beds: globally distributed ejecta layers created by Chicxulub-sized or larger cratering events4. At least seven spherule beds have been found that formed between 3.23 and 3.47 Gyr ago, four between 2.49 and 2.63 Gyr ago, and one between 1.7 and 2.1 Gyr ago5,6,7,8,9. Here we report that the LHB lasted much longer than previously thought, with most late impactors coming from the E belt, an extended and now largely extinct portion of the asteroid belt between 1.7 and 2.1 astronomical units from Earth. This region was destabilized by late giant planet migration10,11,12,13. E-belt survivors now make up the high-inclination Hungaria asteroids14,15. Scaling from the observed Hungaria asteroids, we find that E-belt projectiles made about ten lunar basins between 3.7 and 4.1 Gyr ago. They also produced about 15 terrestrial basins between 2.5 and 3.7 Gyr ago, as well as around 70 and four Chicxulub-sized or larger craters on the Earth and Moon, respectively, between 1.7 and 3.7 Gyr ago. These rates reproduce impact spherule bed and lunar crater constraints."}

In this process, it is important to assess the study quality and risk of bias. The “Quality In Prognosis Studies” (QUIPS) tool has been developed for this purpose and consists of several prompting items categorized into six domains, and each domain is judged on a three-grade scale (low, moderate or high risk of bias). The aim of the present study was to determine the interrater agreement of the risk of bias assessment in prognostic studies of patients with chronic pain using QUIPS and to elaborate on the use of this instrument. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of prognostic factors for long-term outcomes after multidisciplinary rehabilitation in patients with chronic pain. Two researchers rated the risk of bias in 43 published papers in two rounds (15 and 28 papers, respectively). The interrater agreement and Cohen’s quadratic weighted kappa coefficient (κ) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were calculated in all domains and separately for the first and second rounds. The raters agreed in 61% of the domains (157 out of 258), with similar interrater agreement in the first (59%, 53/90) and second rounds (62%, 104/168). The overall weighted kappa coefficient (kappa for all domains and all papers) was weak: κ = 0.475 (95%CI = 0.358–0.601). A “minimal agreement” between the raters was found in the first round, κ = 0.323 (95%CI = 0.129–0.517), but increased to “weak agreement” in the second round, κ = 0.536 (95%CI = 0.390–0.682). Despite a relatively low interrater agreement, QUIPS proved to be a useful tool in assessing the risk of bias when performing a meta-analysis of prognostic studies in pain rehabilitation, since it demands of raters to discuss and investigate important aspects of study quality. Some items were particularly hard to differentiate in-between, and a learning phase was required to increase the interrater agreement. This paper highlights several aspects of the tool that should be kept in mind when rating the risk of bias in prognostic studies, and provides some suggestions on common pitfalls to avoid during this process.

The basic results obtained with the mathematical models are presented. The most important causes affecting the formation of the common rhythm—the pacemaker potential shape in the slow diastolic depolarization phase, its porosity, the coupling force between pacemakers, and the electrical power of pacemakers—are revealed. Rhythmogenesis is studied using the modified axiomatic model. The method allows the calculation of the common rhythm of the sinoatrial node, with allowance for the mutual effect of the pacemaker cells, including the coupling force, electric power of cells, and possibility of the cells clustering. It has been shown that the common rhythm of the sinoatrial node is generally formed at the intermediate level of the rhythms of all pacemaker cells."}

Identification of the Bcr-Abl kinase fusion protein and its pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CML provided new opportunities to develop molecular-targeted therapies. Imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland), which specifically inhibits the autophosphorylation of the Abl TK, has improved the treatment of CML. However, resistance is often reported in patients with advanced-stage disease. Several novel TK inhibitors have been developed that override IM resistance mechanisms caused by point mutations within the Abl kinase domain. Inhibitors of Abl TK are divided into two main groups, namely, ATP-competitive and ATP noncompetitive inhibitors. The ATP-competitive inhibitors fall into two subclasses, the Src/Abl inhibitors, and the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine-based compounds. Dasatinib (formerly BMS-354825), AP23464, SKI-606, and PD166326 are classified as Src/Abl inhibitors, while nilotinib (AMN107) and INNO-406 (NS-187) belong to the latter subclass of inhibitors. Of these agents, dasatinib and nilotinib underwent clinical trials earlier than the others and favorable results are now accumulating. Clinical studies of the other compounds, including SKI-606 and INNO-406, have been performed in rapid succession. Because of their strong affinities for the ATP-binding site compared to IM, most ATP-competitive inhibitors may be effective in IM-resistant patients. However, an ATP-competitive inhibitor that can inhibit the phosphorylation of T315I Bcr-Abl has not yet been developed. Instead, ATP noncompetitive inhibitors, such as ON012380, Aurora kinase inhibitor MK0457 (VX-680), and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor BIRB-796, have been developed to address this problem. This review provides an update on the underlying pathophysiologies of disease progression and IM resistance, and discusses the development of new targeted TK inhibitors for managing CML and the importance of future strategies targeting CML stem cells."}

In contrast to the results of a previous Rietveld structure refinement, which shows a negative or null thermal expansion of Ir—O and Ca—O bond lengths within the average long-range structure, visual inspection of these atom-pair distances in the pair-distribution function, in addition to structure models fitted through least-squares refinement to this local-structure data, strongly suggests that these distances between atom pairs increase with temperature. The average long-range structure of CaIrO3, visible from Rietveld structure refinement, is distinct from the short-range structure (≤ 18 Å) at all of the temperatures examined in this study (325–1114 K) and is reproduced in structure models fitted to the pair-distribution function extending to sufficiently long atom-pair distances (≥ 50 Å). While previous data obtained with Rietveld structure refinement show the iridium coordination octahedra to distort with increasing temperature, models of the short-range structure demonstrate that these polyhedra instead reduce distortion and rotate in a manner similar to that occurring in the perovskite structure."}

A comprehensive search of in-vitro , in-vivo , and clinical findings of pomegranate and its derivatives focusing on the highly qualified original studies and systematic reviews are carried out in valid international web databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. Relevant studies have demonstrated that pomegranate and its derivatives can modulate the expression and activity of several genes, enzymes, and receptors through influencing oxidative stress and inflammation pathways. Different parts of pomegranate; roots, bark, blossoms, fruits, and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols, flavonoids , anthocyanins, and ellagitannins , that have preventive and therapeutic effects against many disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurological diseases , and cancers without any serious adverse effects . Most recent scientific evidence indicates that all parts of the pomegranate can be helpful in treating a wide range of chronic disorders due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. Since the safety of pomegranate fruit, juice, and extracts is established, further investigations can be designed by targeting its active antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituents to discover new drugs. • Pomegranate traditional utilizations made it a holistic and symbolic herb world widely. • Pomegranate's advantages are mentioned in almost every religion and culture. • Every part of pomegranate is rich of anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory compounds. • Pomegranate is a powerful weapon against cancer, CVDs, musculoskeletal, sexual, and neurological ischemic diseases. • Its extracts have potential benefits against endocrine system dysfunction, skin photoaging, and drugs fatal side effects."}

Choledochal cyst is nearly always associated with pancreatico-biliary malunion (PBMU) and is often associated with dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBD). Before cyst excision, detailed information must be obtained about IHBD abnormalities such as ductal stenosis and dilatation, presence of debris or stones, and intrapancreatic bile duct anomalies such as PBMU or dilatation of the pancreatic duct and presence of debris or protein plugs in the common channel. Today, magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) allow preoperative visualization of the precise anatomy of the hepato-biliary-pancreatic ductal system in most cases of choledochal cyst. Although MRCP is highly accurate, it may not clearly visualize PBMU if the patient is an infant or a young child, and ERCP is generally contraindicated if pancreatitis is present. If information obtained from MRCP and/or ERCP is insufficient, intraoperative cholangiography is indicated."}

This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of insect extracts against Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of thirteen crude extracts of medicinal insects were tested against twelve Gram-negative bacteria by diffusion on agar. Imipenem was used as an antibiotic for positive control. The thirteen extracts acted differently against certain Gram-negative bacteria. The largest inhibition diameter was for extracts of Cirina butyrospermi and Mylabris variabilis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 and Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076, respectively. The diameters of inhibition obtained using imipenem against these same bacterial strains were 13.0 ± 0.0 mm and 22 ± 1.0 mm, respectively. The lowest inhibition diameter (7.5 ± 0.0 mm) was obtained using Anopheles gambiae extract against Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028. Imipenem was active on all strains tested. The highest values of the index multi-resistance to insect’s extracts were reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027 and Serratia odorifera 652411. Overall, the results of this study confirmed the antibacterial activities of insects used by traditional health practitioners to treat different pathologies. Entomotherapy could be an alternative treatment for certain infectious pathologies caused by gram-negative bacteria."}

Although the average age for initiation of morbidity has delayed, chronic diseases like hypertension, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders are still prevalent in affluent aging societies leading to death. Therefore, studying dietary interventions and pathology of aging can prove as an essential strategy for achieving healthy aging. The recent researches demonstrated an association of aging with remarkable elevation in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stress. The plant-based molecules have successfully modulated lifespan and stress level across various species. These phytomolecules are secondary plant metabolites which play a major role in plant defence network and are synthesized as side tracks of plant’s primary metabolism. Despite the recently discovered potential of some phytomolecules in alleviating age-related stress, antiaging and stress modulatory potential of most of them is still unraveled. The natural dietary intervention modulating lifespan and health span in model organisms should be vastly studied for improving later life health. The free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, provides a unique and expedient platform for studying pharmacological interventions and dissecting the genetic mechanism underlying aging. The present chapter highlights the medicinal and therapeutic potential of the various Ocimum species which is commonly known as the “Queen of the herbs.” The antioxidant and antiaging potential of phytomolecules and extracts derived from this genus is thoroughly reported. Basil is the rich repository of many bioactive molecules such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, anthocyanins, and phenolic acids; therefore, the longevity-promoting potential of this herb is highlighted in the present chapter. Furthermore, special attention is given to the employment of C. elegans model system for screening various phytochemicals isolated from Ocimum spp."}

The purpose of the article is to determine the features of the relationship between the level of digital technologies and human capital development in the countries around the world under the conditions of the emergence of Society 5.0.\r\nMethodology / approach. The research is based on general scientific research methods, such as analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, comparison, systematization and generalization. Bibliographic analysis, standardization, correlation analysis (calculation of Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlation coefficients), cluster analysis and data visualization techniques were also used in the research process.\r\nResults. The literature review shows that a key postulate of the Society 5.0 concept is human-centeredness combined with a high level of digital technology development. In this context, the features of the relationship between the level of human capital development and the degree of a country digitization have been identified in the study. The results of the analysis show that there is a direct rather strong relationship between HCI and NRI, and HCI and NRI sub-indices for the sample of 131 countries for 2020. These findings are supported by the results of analyses based on the calculation of Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlation coefficients. Further analysis showed that this dependence is not homogeneous for the whole sample. As a result of the cluster analysis, four clusters were identified and correlation coefficients were calculated for each cluster. Scatterplot and Box &amp; Whisker plot diagrams for clusters were also plotted. It turned out that the relationship between the analyzed indicators varies by groups of countries.\r\nOriginality / scientific novelty. The results of the analysis show that the level of human capital development is closely linked to the level of society digitalization. However, this relationship is not homogeneous. This confirms the need to implement the Society 5.0 approach to the human development problems.\r\nPractical value / implications. The article proposes an approach to assess the relationship between the degree of digitalisation of society and the quality of the human factor in the economy. The obtained results can be used to justify the directions and tools for the implementation of state policy to support human capital development, taking into account the factors and characteristics of Society 5.0."}

However, current pharmacology research strategies have struggled to identify effective substance groups and encountered challenges in elucidating the underlying mechanisms of TCMF. In this study, a comprehensive strategy was proposed and applied to elucidate the interactions of the multiple components that underlie the functions of the famous TCMF: Xian-Ling-Gu-Bao (XLGB) capsule on bone metabolism in vivo and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of XLGB on bone cells, especially on osteoblasts. The efficacy of XLGB in the protection against bones loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats was confirmed by Micro-CT analysis. The anti-osteoporosis mechanism involved in the systemic regulatory actions of XLGB was elucidated by transcriptome sequencing analysis on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells isolated from OVX rats. Moreover, the components absorbed in XLGB-treated plasma were characterized by mass spectrometry analysis, and subsequently, a standardized preparation process of drug-containing plasma was established. The synergistic osteogenic effect of the multiple components in plasma was investigated by a combination and then knockout of components using pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells. In order to decipher the underlying mechanism of XLGB, the targets of the absorbed components on bone were predicted by target prediction and network pharmacology analysis, then several interactions were validated by biochemical and cell-based assay. A total of 18 genes, including HDC , CXCL1/2, TNF , IL6 and Il1b, were newly found to be the major target genes regulated by XLGB. Interestingly, we found that a combination of the three absorbed components, i.e. MSP, rather than their single form at the same concentration, stimulated the formation of calcified nodules in MC3T3-E1 cells, suggesting a synergistic effect of these components. Besides, target prediction and experimental validation confirmed the binding affinity of corylin and icaritin for estrogen receptor α and β, the inhibitory activity of isobavachin and isobavachalcone on glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and the inhibitory activity of isobavachalcone on cathepsin K. The cell-based assay further confirmed the result of the biochemical assay. A network that integrated absorbed components of XLGB-targets-perturbation genes-pathways against osteoporosis was established. Our current study provides a new systemic strategy for discovering active ingredient groups of TCM formulae and understanding their underlying mechanisms."}

Their exposure to radicals occurs on short millisecond time scales and has been consistently found not to cause any measurable structural damage or conformational change to proteins in a number of published reports. Consistent with these studies, S-peptide is preferentially protected from reactions with radicals under conditions in which it is bound to S-protein. Conversely, a region of S-protein comprising residues 96−100 constitutes the S-peptide binding domain based on its diminished reactivity with radicals within the RNase−S complex over the free S-protein.

The current study systematically assesses the long-term LULC-NDVI-LST relationship within the Ong watershed (4650 km 2 ) in central India, located in the Mahanadi River basin over a four decade period (1980–2020). Using NDVI as a proxy for vegetation health and cover, the study investigates how anthropogenically driven LULC alterations have influenced regional thermal regimes. Leveraging multi-decadal Landsat imagery and a random forest classifier, the analysis reveals a substantial forest cover decline from 40.4 % to 29.8 % (−10.6 %), accompanied by cropland expansion (+311 km 2 ) and built-up area growth (+69 %). These transitions resulted in a progressive increase in LST of up to 3 °C and an average NDVI reduction of approximately 9 % (from 0.32 to 0.29), indicating signs of ecosystem stress. The NDVI-LST relationship exhibits a strong negative correlation, particularly for the forest class ( R 2  = 0.84 before 2000 and R 2  = 0.55 after 2000), followed by cropland ( R 2  = 0.51 before 2000 and R 2  = 0.54 after 2000). This study provides a practical LULC-NDVI-LST nexus relationship as a sustainability indicator for assessing watershed degradation and LULCA sensitivity. The outcomes provide guidance for prioritizing LULC classes and promoting climate-resilient watershed management aligned with sustainable development goals."}

The interesting feature of the Darlington Project is that its development covered the period since 1985, and therefore the transition to the reorganisation of health and social care in the early 1990s. There are two main types of cost opportunities arising from the development of secondary care in the community. The first of these is concerned generally with the shortening of hospital patients’ lengths of stay. The second opportunity arises from the substitution of community-based for continuing care in hospital. The key role of the core tasks of care management played an important part of the success of the Darlington Project."}

This idea – embracing an enormously vast and rich set of connotations – is being reconstructed here on the basis of prolific philosophical output of the German thinker. Although Jaspers is generally acclaimed to have been an existentialist1 he flatly rejected the very term as well as philosophical movement itself to which he was supposed to have belonged, as represented by the French – Sartre and Camus and his one-time colleague – Heidegger. Time and again on many occassions the author of Philosophie preferred instead to refer to his philosophical output as an unique version of transcendental Existenzphilosophie mainly devoted to the enlightening of Being, unfolding its meaning and sense, finally our existential relation to the world we are in. In his unending and unremitting analyses Jaspers has presented and developed illuminating and decisive ideas well grounded in a conception of the human being (Dasein) existing in a given reality on three, intimately related with each other-levels: an empirical being, a consciousness in general and spirit, and on a conception of a project of humanity itself. The latter expresses the transcendental idea of a human condition in general – to wit – Existenz. This fundamental notion is always treated by Jaspers in terms of our freedom and potentiality, spontaneity and “breaking away from” which the philosopher along with other existential thinkers unequivocally calls our facticity, our “immersion” in the pregiven world.2 As Jaspers focusses on describing, then unravelling and evaluating our condition it stands to reason that he inevitably must deal with certain traits displaying – as it were – the very dimension of our being-in-the-world. Put it differently, human beings are always in a particular – historical, economic, intellectual, and spiritual – situation and may be exposed to oft dramatic, even tragic but nevertheless fruitful experiences. The author of Philosophie refers to them as Grenzsituationen (covering the particulary sensitive areas of our existence) such as death, suffering, guilt and strife. One may be fully justified in saying that these not only point to the dimension we have already alluded to but also constitute the indubitable core of being really human. Moreover, these factors informing the existence of each individual Dasein demand the initiation of the most invaluable, precious and truly authentic acts on our part. The philosopher names them the acts of communication (another key term in his version of transcendental existentialism) that is communication of and with Others along with Existenz itself. Jaspers underlines yet another essential fact geared up with the human condition. As we that is, our subjectivity along with the so called reality, (the transcendent world) happen to find ourselves in the world we have not constituted (however for no evident, rational or logical reason we often search for in vain) there emerges a third element, a third party to which we (us and the world) point; namely, Transcendence. According to H. Arendt – a disciple and a friend of both Heidegger and Jaspers the latter may be deemed as the only true Kantian philosophers of many persuasions who unlike academic philosopher has taken a subjective or – more precisely – intersubjective stance. Having chosen such an attitude (discarding a purely uncommitted, objective approach to the transcendent reality (an sich) Jaspers proposed a “reinterpreated conception of modern transcendentalism”.3 Along with such key terms as subjective and intersubjective, there is this significant notion of transcendental. The latter seems to point to one of the main sources of the inspiration which has certainly exerted an influence on the work of this German thinker."}

Lawlor", "affiliations": ["Wake Forest University, USA"], "is_corresponding": false}], "abstract": "In this chapter we make good on a promise from the introductory material and project the own-rates framework into familiar macroeconomic contexts, including its implications for IS/LM analysis. We do so by way of an implicit critique of Leijonhufvud’s “The Wicksell Connection.” This will also serve as a conclusion to our book in the sense that it demonstrates a main theme which was argued throughout this work and which culminated in Chapter 14. The own-rates of interest analysis offers an important avenue by which to demonstrate Keynes’s claim for the existence of unemployment equilibria. Keynes based his argument in this area on forces integral to an economy faced with uncertainty, where asset holders might choose to fly to safety. In such an economy he suggested there would be (at least) one asset exhibiting a liquidity premia in excess of its carrying cost. This is how he defined a monetary economy. This existence did not make the attainment of full-employment impossible, though, as Leijonhufvud argues. It does mean, however, that — given institutions, expectations and the propensities to save and to consume — it is possible for new investment activity to get hung up at a level lower than the full-employment level of savings. What would happen then? One possibility is that output adjusts to this new lower level of demand and settles into a less-than-full employment equilibrium."}

We investigated potential links between the review times in Japan and the attributes of NDAs, the regulatory agency and pharmaceutical companies.\nMethods:  We analysed new drugs approved in 2000–2009 in Japan using a proprietary database collected through annual surveys to pharmaceutical companies. Regression models in which individual firms were treated as either a fixed effect or a random effect were applied to examine factors associated with the overall review time and the duration of each step of the review.\nResults and Discussion:  The fixed effect model analysis using variations within each firm indicated that new molecular entities that were submitted to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), priority reviews and pre-NDA consultations were associated with a shorter overall review time, whereas additional studies during the review resulted in a longer review. In the random effect model analysis using both within- and between-firm variations, use of end-of-phase 2 consultations and foreign clinical data also had negative coefficients, suggesting the effect of these two vary among firms. Analysis of each step of the review process revealed NDAs reviewed by the Committee on Drugs under the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the number of NDAs assigned to a review team were significantly linked with their duration, whereas consultation services and the number of reviewers had no relation.\nWhat is new and Conclusion:  Factors associated with each step of the review process as well as the differences in attributes and strategies among pharmaceutical companies should be considered to further improve the speed, quality and efficiency of the regulatory review."}

Expression of miR-181a was detected by qRT-PCR in three normal gastric tissues and three human gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MGC-803, and BGC-823 cells). After transfection with miR-181a inhibitor, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of the SGC-7901 cells were evaluated. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM) was predicted as a target gene of miR-181a with bioinformatics analysis, and was verified by lucifersae reporter assay. Expression of ATM protein in HEK293T cells and tissues was measured by Western Blot. Expression of ATM mRNA in HEK293T cells was measured by RT-PCR. Compared with three non-tumour tissues, the expression of miR-181a in three gastric cancer cells was significantly increased by 26.68, 14.83 and 14.96 folds; Compared with Negative Control(NC) and blank groups, transfection of miR-181a inhibitor led to inhibition of SGC7901 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration as well as promotion of apoptosis. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ATM was a direct target of miR-181a, miR-181a mimics transfection down regulated ATM mRNA and protein expression. There was inverse correlation between miR-181a and ATM protein expression in gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues. Our study demonstrates that over-expression of miR-181a might be involved in development of gastric cancer by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis probably through directly targeting ATM. miR-181a modulation may be a potential strategy for the development of miRNA-based therapy of gastric cancer."}

In the first facility, which is located in North America, the values of cycle time and WIP inventory predicted by each model are about 10% higher than the actual values observed in the facility. The estimates are on the high side because managers and operators in the facility take special action to expedite production whenever queues become too large or small. These special actions cannot be incorporated into the open queueing network models. In the second facility, which is taken from the literature, the values of cycle time and WIP predicted by each model are about 5% higher than the values reported in the literature. An investigation at a third facility located in South-east Asia identified a common manufacturing practice that caused a model assumption to be violated. New insights into the models and directions for future research are identified. We find that two of the four open queueing network models are easy to apply and give good results for facilities like the ones studied in this paper. The other two models are complex and are likely to be better-suited for more complex facilities. "}

The digital rock model is constructed by simulating a natural deposit of matrix particles with different shapes and radius. Based on the simulation results, it was found that both dispersed clay and laminated clay can lead to a non-Archie relationship of F-ϕ. The non-Archie effect of laminated clay on the F-ϕ relationship was more significant than that of dispersed clay.

Therefore, the combustion consequence should be analyzed to demonstrate that the containment integrity is not be challenged for the hydrogen risk when the Flame Acceleration risk cannot be safely ruled out. Considering the uncertainties of both the combustion model and severe accident analysis, the CRiteria and Experimentally Based Combustion (CREBCOM) model is adopted to provide a conservative result for pressure and thermal load for combustion analyses in this study. Firstly, the CREBCOM is developed in the GASFLOW-MPI code, and validated with the RUT experiment. The result shows that the CREBCOM model can provide a reliable over pressure for the choking regime combustion. Then this model is adopted for the hydrogen safety analysis for the Advanced PWR 1000. The hydrogen distribution is calculated with the mass and energy release obtained from severe accident analysis, from which, the most unfavorable ignition time and location is selected. The result of the CREBCOM model is compared with that of the Turbulent Flame Closure (TFC) model, which is a commonly used model for combustion analysis in containment safety. The results show that the CREBCOM model can provide a conservative prediction for the pressure and thermal load of combustion. Therefore, the CREBCOM model with the sonic flame assumption is applicable for the FA risk analysis in local compartment for nuclear containments where a sonic-deflagration can not be safely excluded, and manage to obtain a conservative pressure and thermal load for further evaluation on the containment integrity."}

A total of 215 patients with GISTs were retrospectively analyzed, including 150 patients in one hospital as the training set and 65 patients in another hospital as the external verification set. The tumor at the largest level of CT images was delineated as the region of interest (ROI). The maximum diameter of the ROI was defined as the tumor size. A total of 851 radiomics features were extracted from each ROI by 3D Slicer Radiomics. After dimensionality reduction, three machine learning classification algorithms including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were used for Ki-67 expression prediction. Using a multivariable logistic model, a nomogram was established to predict the expression of Ki-67 individually. Delong tests showed that the SVM models had the highest accuracy in the arterial phase (Z value 0.217–1.139) and venous phase (Z value 0.022–1.396). For the plain phase, LR and SVM models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.874–1.824, 1.139–1.763). For the delayed phase, LR models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.056–1.824). For the combined phase, RF models had the highest accuracy (Z value 0.232–1.978). There was no significant difference among the above models for KI-67 expression prediction (Z value 0.022–1.978). A nomogram was developed with a C-index of 0.913 (95% CI, 0.878 to 0.956). Radiomics of both plain and enhanced CT images could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST. For patients who were not suitable to use contrast agents, plain scan could be used as an alternative. CT radiomics could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST, which has a great clinical value in reflecting the proliferative activity of tumor cells and helping determine whether a patient is suitable for adjuvant therapy with imatinib. • Radiomics of both plain and enhanced CT images could accurately predict the expression of Ki-67 in GIST. • For patients who were not suitable to use contrast agents, plain scan could be used as an alternative. • A radiomics nomogram was developed to allow personalized preoperative evaluation with high accuracy."}

In this paper for symmetric distributions, a test statistic based on the signed ranks of the data is discussed and investigated. The proposed test statistic is obtained by computing Hotelling's T 2 statistic as a function of the signed ranks and is equivalent to a statistic of Puri and Sen (1971).

No study of the variation within or between species or genera is required, so, in the majority of cases, none is made. Cowan2 has suggested the abolition of priority, and recognition of only such forms as are preserved as type cultures. The difficulty here is that cultures tend to vary upon repeated subculture, some properties (for example, agar digestion, motility, luminescence) being lost very rapidly by some strains. This is especially the case with sapro-phytic forms and is probably not appreciated by those who work only with the more stable pathogenic types and their allies. Furthermore, few type culture collections will include these saprophytic forms."}

This study analysed cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the PsyCorona Survey that included 54,845 participants from 112 countries, of which 23,278 participants are representative samples of 24 countries in terms of gender and age. Specification curve analysis (SCA) was used to examine associations of risk perception of COVID-19 with emotion and self-rated mental health. This robust method considers all reasonable model specifications to avoid subjective analytical decisions while accounting for multiple testing. All 162 multilevel linear regressions in the SCA indicated that higher risk perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with less positive or more negative emotions (median standardised β =-0.171, median SE=0.004, P <0.001). Specifically, regressions involving economic risk perception and negative emotions revealed stronger associations. Moreover, risk perception at baseline survey was inversely associated with subsequent mental health (standardised β =-0.214, SE=0.029, P <0.001). We further used SCA to explore whether this inverse association was mediated by emotional distress.

This retrospective study included patients with idiopathic ERM who underwent vitrectomy between January 2018 and December 2019. We evaluated the preoperative examination results. Using cross-sectional spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) images along the horizontal/vertical meridian through the fovea, we defined a new parameter, tangential displacement (TD), as the tangential component of the position vector of the distorted outer nuclear layer caused by ERM. Visual function measurements included M-CHARTS results (vertical/horizontal metamorphopsia score [MV/MH]) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). The correlations among the OCT parameters including TD and central foveal thickness (CFT) with visual function measurements were determined. Overall, 78 eyes of 76 patients (49 females; mean age, 67.9 [± standard deviation, 7.5 years]) were included. The mean horizontal TD was 24.0 ± 73.9 μm, which was significantly different from 0 (p = 0.005). The mean vertical TD was 6.0 ± 76.2 μm, which was not significantly different from 0. The absolute value of horizontal TD was significantly correlated with MV (r = 0.513, p < 0.01) and MH (r = 0.423, p < 0.01). The absolute value of vertical TD was also significantly correlated with MV (r = 0.274, p = 0.02) and MH (r = 0.413, p < 0.01). However, neither value was significantly correlated with BCVA. Multiple regression analysis showed that the horizontal absolute TD was an independent factor associated with both MV (β = 0.635, p < 0.001) and MH (β = 0.259, p = 0.048). We found that ERM tended to distort the outer retinal layer toward the temporal side of the fovea.

It was found that these π-spacers not only reduced their energy losses, even they produced surplus stabilization energy when compared to their open circuit voltages. Also, it was found that the insertion of highly sp 2 hybridized π-spacer unit can produced a higher push-pull effect with maximum absorption ( λ max ) up to 1389 nm as compared to pure donor part with higher electron injection capability. All the optimized molecular geometries were planar in their structure having a variation in their dihedral angles to 0.50–1.03ᵒ. their chemical stability evaluation, as softness and hardness, showed that these switches were chemical persistent to be used for the organic hole-transport applications. Their charge distribution patterns, evident from their frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), showed a shifting of charges to their π-spacer units gradually to indicate their involvement in charge transfer process. Their open circuit voltage against the pure N, N-Dimethylamino-3-acetamido-4-methoxybenzylideneaniline (DAMA) produced their significant value ranges of 1.58–4.71eV, while their short circuit current (J sc) to have 20.36–81.79 mA/cm 2 . Their natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis demonstrated that transitions involving more electronegative donor units were more stabilized and an overall second perturbance energy was observed up to 50 kcal/mol. Overall this research is a good example of managing the organic photovoltaic ( PV ) systems for their efficient energy offsets by using the proper π-spacers in between the donor and acceptor architectures. • π-spacers reduced energy loss and enhanced stability. • Strong sp 2 π-spacers achieved λ max up to 1389 nm. • Planar geometries showed minimal dihedral angle variation. • Charge transfer localized through π-spacer in FMOs. • High Voc (1.58–4.71 eV) and Jsc (20.36–81.79 mA/cm 2 )."}

In this paper, we propose a novel network called a multi-scale local cost volume network (MLCVNet) that can extract multi-scale features and inter-frame motion information. We use a multi-scale local cost volume module to obtain the object’s displacement information between current and historical frames, and the historic features will be mapped into the current features to obtain enhanced features through which objects can be detected and tracked. Some experiments have been conducted on remote sensing videos, which are collected from the Jilin-1 satellite, and the results have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-art performance."}

The methodology also entails the analysis of graphs based on the digital economy and society index, exemplifying the latest information regarding the position of Romania in respect of small and medium-sized enterprises (and not only) that implemented artificial intelligence compared to the other countries in the European Union. Exonia's example shows how small and medium enterprises can make artificial intelligence an opportunity to obtain more efficient operations and happier customers.

We had previously explored the evolutionary consequences of the existence of indeterminate—“plastic”—loci, where a plastic locus had a finite probability in each generation of functioning (being switched “on”) or not functioning (being switched “off”). The relative probabilities of the two outcomes were assigned on a stochastic basis. The present paper examines what happens when the transition probabilities are biased by the presence of regulatory genes. We find that under certain conditions regulatory genes can improve the adaptation of the population and speed up the rate of evolution (on occasion at the cost of lowering the degree of adaptation). Also, the existence of regulatory loci potentiates selection in favour of plasticity. There is a synergistic effect of regulatory genes on plastic alleles: the frequency of such alleles increases when regulatory loci are present. Thus, phenotypic selection alone can be a potentiating factor in a favour of better adaptation."}

Preclinical, prospective, and retrospective studies were included. There is no published randomized controlled trials, evaluating the role of surgery in mPCa. Preclinical and retrospective data suggest benefit of primary tumor treatment in mPCa. Current literature supports the concept of cytoreductive surgery as it can prevent late symptomatic local progression, has acceptable complications, and may prolong survival in patients with mPCa. Surgery is a feasible procedure in mPCa which may improve outcome in mPCa. However, there is no Level 1 evidence, yet that support the role of surgery in mPCa. The results from well-organized prospective, randomized controlled trials are awaited before performing radical prostatectomy for mPCa in clinical practice."}

Moreover, indirect defenses through chemotactic responses of Trichogramma pretiosum (Riley) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) submitted to the same treatments were investigated. Direct defense was evaluated by measuring weight gain of fall armyworm larvae fed with leaves of plants previously exposed to herbivores or treated with MJ (2 and 5 mM), SA (8 and 16 mM), or control. Indirect defense was verified by chemotactic behavior of wasps in two-choice olfactometer tests to plants exposed to herbivores and evaluated after 24, 48, and 72 h in comparison with undamaged ones, as well as plants treated with the same phytohormones contrasted with the control. The gain of weight was reduced in immature developmental stage of S. frugiperda fed in leaves previously damaged by fall armyworm and in newly formed leaves after damage to the plants, comparing with control. Leaves treated with MJ (2 mM and 5 mM) and SA (8 mM) were less eaten than those not treated. Parasitoids triggered a positive chemotactic behavior in rice plants that had been sprayed with same concentrations. This study showed that rice plants can activate direct and indirect defenses through an exogenous application of phytohormones."}

It explores the effect of a range of physiological stiffnesses on endothelial cell lineages. Tissue culture plastic, where endothelial cells are usually studied and cultured, have an elastic modulus of 106 kPa. This is orders of magnitude stiffer than the physiological stiffness, which is in the 0.1-100 kPa range. Therefore, it is important to study\n        the effects of stem cell differentiation on more compliant stiffnesses suitable for the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells. The modifications are achieved through altering polyacrylamide matrix stiffness and seeding the stem cells on a Matrigel coating. Moreover, pluripotent stem cell derived endothelial cells have not been studied before on a continuous range of stiffness. In summary, the goals of this project are to develop a polyacrylamide stiffness protocol, explore the\n        relationship of stiffness on endothelial cell differentiation, and evaluate the effect of specific stiffnesses on endothelial cell lineages. Five polyacrylamide stiffnesses were selected, human embryonic stem cells were seeded and induced to differentiate into endothelial cells. The qPCR results showcase that at the intermediate to high stiffnesses of C: 29.14 kPa and D: 66.01 kPa the cells upregulated more cardiac markers. Therefore, it is assumed that cells on these stiffnesses have\n        differentiated from human embryonic stem cells into cardiac endothelial cells. This emphasizes the need for futher studies to investigate a finer polyacrylamide stiffness within that range in order to understand optimal cardiac endothelial cell substrate stiffness.--Author's abstract"}

They also confirmed that taxonomic categories were perceived as more coherent than script categories. In Experiment 1 participants completed an induction task in which information from multiple categories could be searched and combined to generate a property prediction about a target food. Multiple categories were more often consulted and used in prediction for script primary than for taxonomic primary foods. Experiment 2 replicated this finding across a range of property types but found that multiple category reasoning was reduced in the presence of a concurrent cognitive load. Property type affected which categories were consulted first and how information from multiple categories was weighted. The results show that multiple categories are more likely to be used for property predictions about cross-classified objects when an object is primarily associated with a category that has low coherence."}

Several retrospective studies have reported a positive association between HRRv and the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy. However, this association remains to be validated in a prospective study. This multicenter, prospective, observational study included patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or recurrent pancreatic cancer who required systemic chemotherapy. Patients who were oxaliplatin-naïve patients were eligible. The HRRv status was measured using a College of American Pathologists-accredited NGS panel. One-year overall survival rate (1yr-OS%) was calculated after initiation of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and was set as the primary endpoint. Forty patients were enrolled between August 2018 and March 2020. The NGS success rate was 95% (38/40). HRRv was detected in 11 patients (27.5%). Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy was administered to 9 of 11 patients with HRRv (81.8%) and 15 of 29 patients with non-HRRv (51.7%). The 1yr-OS% after initiation of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy was 44.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.7–71.9] and 57.1% (95% CI 28.4–78.0) in HRRv-positive and -negative cohorts, respectively. These data suggested that HRRv status alone could not be a potential predictive marker of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. These results were in line with the results of a recent phase II study reporting the limited efficacy of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase inhibitor in patients with pancreatic cancer who harbored HRRv other than BRCA. Future studies investigating patients with biallelic HRRv in the first-line setting are warranted. Trial registration UMIN000033655."}

PHP-Ia patients show Gsα protein deficiency, PTH resistance, and typical Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). Heterozygous mutations in the GNAS1 gene encoding the Gsα protein have been identified both in PHP-Ia and in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP), a disorder with isolated AHO. A single GNAS1 mutation may be responsible for both PHP-Ia and PPHP in the same family when inherited from the maternal and the paternal allele, respectively, suggesting that GNAS1 is an imprinted gene. To evaluate whether molecular diagnosis is a useful tool to characterize AHO and PHP when testing for Gsα activity and PTH resistance is not available, we have performed GNAS1 mutational analysis in 43 patients with PTH resistance and/or AHO. Sequencing of the whole coding region of the GNAS1 gene identified 11 mutations in 18 PHP patients, eight of which have not been reported previously. Inheritance was ascertained in 13 cases, all of whom had PHP-Ia: the mutated alleles were inherited from the mothers, who had AHO (PPHP), consistent with the proposed imprinting mechanism. GNAS1 molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of PHP-Ia and PPHP in the mutated patients. Our results stress the usefulness of this approach to obtain a complete diagnosis, expand the GNAS1 mutation spectrum, and illustrate the wide mutation heterogeneity of PHP and PHP-Ia."}

Contact angles varied widely from liquid to liquid and from surface to surface. Surface roughness was relatively unimportant. Instead, the contact angles seemed to be more closely tied to the chemical nature of the surfaces. In general, contact angles increased with the liquid surface tension and decreased with the surface tension of the solid. Several definitions were used to calculate contact angle hysteresis from the experimental data. Although hysteresis is usually considered an extensive property, we found that on a given surface a wide range of liquids gave a unique value of reduced hysteresis. Apparently, reduced hysteresis represents an intrinsic parameter describing liquid–solid interactions."}

Unlike existing software, the new simulation tool is fully based on existing capabilities of PHREEQC without source code modifications or coupling to external software packages. Because of the direct integration, the full set of PHREEQC's geochemical reactions with connected databases for reaction constants is immediately accessible. Thus, unsaturated flow and solute transport can be simulated together with complex solution speciation, equilibrium and kinetic mineral reactions, redox reactions, ion exchange reactions and surface adsorption including diffuse double layer calculations. Liquid phase flow is solved as a result of element advection , where the Darcy flux is calculated according to Richards' equation. For accurate representation of advection-dominated transport, a total-variation-diminishing scheme was implemented. Dispersion was simulated with a standard approach; however, PHREEQC's multicomponent transport capabilities can be used to simulate species-dependent diffusion. Since liquid phase saturation is recalculated after every reaction step, biogeochemical processes that modify liquid phase saturation, such as dissolution or precipitation of hydrated minerals are considered a priori . Implementation of the numerical schemes for flow and solute transport have been described, along with examples of the extensive code verification, before illustrating more advanced application examples. These include (i) the simulation of infiltration with saturation-dependent cation exchange capacity, (ii) changes in hydraulic properties due to mineral reactions and (iii) transport of mobile organic substances with complexation of heavy metals in varying geochemical conditions."}

We aimed to examine whether relatives’ birth period affected index-child (grand-child) birthweight status in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Cohort in the Republic of Ireland. Participants were 943 mothers and offspring, 890 fathers, 938 maternal grandmothers (MGM), 700 maternal grandfathers (MGF) 537 paternal grandmothers (PGM) and 553 paternal grandfathers (PGF). Index-child’s birthweight was sex-for-gestational age standardised (UK1990 population), and then classified into low birthweight (≤10th percentile) and high-birthweight (≥90th percentile) and compared against normal-birthweight (>10th to <90th percentiles). Four adult birth periods were considered: The Free State (FS, 1916-1938); Emergency Act (EA, 1939-1946); Post-World War-II Baby-Boom (PWWII-BB, 1947-1964); and Modern Ireland (MI, 1964 onwards). Logistic regression was used to assess the crude and adjusted relationship between index-child’s birthweight status and relatives’ birth periods. Overall, there were 8.7% (n=82) index-children in the low-birthweight category, 77.9% (n=735) and 13.4% (n=126) within the normal and high birthweight groups respectively. Index-children whose mothers were born during the PWWII-BB had higher birthweight infants (Crude OR(COR)=1.81 (1.08–3.03) which remained the case only for male index-children when adjusted for co-variables (Adjusted OR(AOR)=4.61(1.71–12.42)). Parents’ combined PWWII-BB birth period was positively associated with male index-child higher birthweight, even adjusted for maternal characteristics (AOR=4.60(1.69–12.50)). MGFs born during the EA were more likely to have grandchildren with low birthweight after adjustment for maternal characteristics (AOR=2.45(1.03-5.85)), particularly for female index-children (AOR=4.74(1.16–19.25)). Both PGMs and PGFs born during the FS period had higher birthweight grandchildren, adjusted for maternal-related co-variables (PGM, AOR=3.23(1.21–8.63); PGF, AOR=3.93(1.11–13.96)), with the effect of PGM more evident in her granddaughter (AOR=6.53(1.25–34.04)). In conclusion, there is some evidence that period of grandparental birth is associated with their grandchildren’s birthweights, suggesting that transgenerational exposures may be particular to historical context, meriting further exploration. • Maternal grandfathers born during Emergency period, had granddaughters with low birthweight. • Maternal grandparents born during FS period, had grandchildren with higher birthweight. • Grandparental adverse exposure at birth is associated with their grandchildren’s birthweights."}

To eliminate the impacts of uncertainties and negative weights for the traffic network performance, the adaptive pinning control and coupling adjustment strategies are designed to estimate controller parameters and adjust coupling strength to compensate for the impacts on the pinned nodes and unpinned nodes. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, adaptive pinning controllers and network adjusters are developed to guarantee the achievement of network synchronization even in the presence of the uncertainties and negative weights. In addition, we investigate the effects of the type of nodes on pinning synchronization performance. Numerical simulations show that if the network’s degree and the single node energy index are considered, better synchronization performance can be obtained by comparing with the pervious pinning schemes."}

with lung adenocarcinoma. Methods: Potentially functional SNPs were selected using integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. The associations of 279 SNPs with chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in 314 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent PEM chemotherapy. Results: Among the SNPs investigated, 18 were significantly associated with response to chemotherapy, while 28 with OS. Of these SNPs, rs549794A>G in an enhancer which is expected to regulate the expression of ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) gene was significantly associated with both worse response to chemotherapy and worse OS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.36–0.97, p = 0.04; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09–1.91, p = 0.01, respectively). Previous studies suggested that RPS3, a multi-functional protein with various extraribosomal activities, may play a role in chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it is postulated that rs549794-induced change in the expression level of RPS3 may affect the response to PEM chemotherapy and consequently the survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Conclusion: This study suggests that genetic variants in the histone modification regions may be useful for the prediction of clinical outcomes of PEM chemotherapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. "}

Following the work of Balcilar et al.

Both methods provide qualitatively similar results. Overall, findings suggest that connectedness in this network is highly responsive to events that greatly affect international financial markets and assume large values across the sample period. Prominent among our results is that the crude oil market is an important net transmitter of volatility shocks across the network during the 2014 oil collapse period. In addition, the period from the beginning of 2018 and until mid-2019 is a rather turbulent period for stock markets a fact which is reflected upon the net receiving character of the market for crude oil. Finally, we show that the Canadian stock market is a persistent net transmitter of volatility in recent years, following developments in international trade and the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis."}

Retention and recall is critical for medical students, and atrophy of knowledge over time following examinations is an established problem in medical education. This study attempted to determine if visual mnemonics are an effective means of learning complex concepts, such as pre-clinical medical science curriculum. This randomized controlled trial was designed as a pre-test, learning phase, and post-test, followed by a one week delayed post-test 2. The learning phase was two hours long, during which participants studied information from four Picmonic© visual mnemonics covering gastrointestinal pathology. Thirty-two participants were assigned to one of four groups. A text group received only a paragraph summarizing the topics, and was instructed to use traditional study techniques (e.g., outlining). An image group used the Picmonic© image and summary text, and the Loci group studied the Picmonic© image and text using the Loci method. A control group took all three tests without going through the learning phase in order to measure the equivalency of the exams. Results show a significant increase in mean correct answers for all three interventions from pre-test to post-test 1 [Text: t(6)=9.260, p<0.001; Image: t(8)=12.336, p<0.001; Loci: t(8)=6.615, p<0.001], as well as a decrease from post-test 1 to post-test 2 [Text: t(6)=4.399, p=0.005; Image: t(8)=4.608, p=0.002; Loci: t(8)=4.667, p=0.002].

Triggers such as inflammation, sarcopenia, and neurohormonal disorders can deplete physiological reserves and accelerate the deterioration of health, thus requiring a multidisciplinary approach to management to meet physical, nutritional, and pharmacological needs. Dietary support and structured exercise can improve physical function, while cautious medication management can reduce the risks associated with frailty. Remote healthcare and wearable technology help with continuous monitoring and timely intervention. The future research direction should aim to develop standardized frailty assessment tools and new therapies, strengthen risk stratification and personalized care. Addressing socio-economic factors can also improve nursing equity.

Deforestation, which is still ongoing in Indonesia, has substantially reduced the habitat of NHPs in the republic. This has led to an intensification of interactions between NHPs and humans, which opens up the possibility of pathogen spillover. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of malarial parasite infections in NHPs in five provinces of Indonesia in 2022. Species of the genus Anopheles that can potentially transmit malarial pathogens to humans were also investigated. An epidemiological survey was conducted by capturing NHPs in traps installed in several localities in the five provinces, including in the surroundings of a wildlife sanctuary. Blood samples were drawn aseptically after the NHPs had been anesthetized; the animals were released after examination. Blood smears were prepared on glass slides, and dried blood spot tests on filter paper. Infections with Plasmodium spp. were determined morphologically from the blood smears, which were stained with Giemsa solution, and molecularly through polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing using rplU oligonucleotides. The NHPs were identified to species level by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 gene as barcoding DNA markers. Mosquito surveillance included the collection of larvae from breeding sites and that of adults through the human landing catch (HLC) method together with light traps. Analysis of the DNA extracted from the dried blood spot tests of the 110 captured NHPs revealed that 50% were positive for Plasmodium, namely Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium coatneyi, Plasmodium inui, Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium sp. Prevalence determined by microscopic examination of the blood smears was 42%. Species of the primate genus Macaca and family Hylobatidae were identified by molecular analysis. The most common mosquito breeding sites were ditches, puddles and natural ponds. Some of the Anopheles letifer captured through HLC carried sporozoites of malaria parasites that can cause the disease in primates. The prevalence of malaria in the NHPs was high. Anopheles letifer, a potential vector of zoonotic malaria, was identified following its collection in Central Kalimantan by the HLC method. In sum, the potential for the transmission of zoonotic malaria in several regions of Indonesia is immense. \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                "}

A close reading into its semiotic landscape and discursive representation discerns complex time-space dynamics that are carefully devised and managed through various spatial and discursive practices in the place.

It has been theorized that cortical feature maps in individuals with autism are inadequate for forming abstract codes and representations. Cortical feature maps make it possible to classify stimuli, such as phonemes of speech, disregarding incidental detail. Hierarchies of such maps are instrumental in creating abstract codes and representations of objects and events. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are artificial neural networks that offer insights into the development of cortical feature maps. Attentional impairment is prevalent in autism, but whether it is caused by attention-shift impairment or strong familiarity preference or negative response to novelty is a matter of debate. We model attention shift during self-organization by presenting a SOM with stimuli from two sources in four different modes, namely, novelty seeking (regarded as normal learning), attention-shift impairment (shifts are made with a low probability), familiarity preference (shifts made with a lower probability to the source that is the less familiar to the SOM of the two sources), and familiarity preference in conjunction with attention-shift impairment. The resulting feature maps from learning with novelty seeking and with attention-shift impairment are much the same except that learning with attention-shift impairment often yields maps with a somewhat better discrimination capacity than learning with novelty seeking. In contrast, the resulting maps from learning with strong familiarity preference are adapted to one of the sources at the expense of the other, and if one of the sources has a set of stimuli with smaller variability, the resulting maps are adapted to stimuli from that source. When familiarity preference is less pronounced, the resulting maps may become normal or fully restricted to one of the sources, and in that case, always the source with smaller variability if such a source is present. Such learning, in a system with many different maps, will result in very uneven capacities. Learning with familiarity preference in conjunction with attention-shift impairment surprisingly has higher probability for the development of normal maps than learning with familiarity preference alone."}

The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) represents a reliable parameter of the inflammatory response. In this study we analyzed the association between NLR and elevated cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in CABM-patients. This study included all (CABM)-patients admitted to a German tertiary center between 2006 and 2016. Patients’ demographics, in-hospital measures, neuroradiological data and clinical outcome were retrieved from institutional databases. CBFv was assessed by transcranial doppler (TCD). Patients’, radiological and laboratory characteristics were compared between patients with/without elevated CBFv. Multivariate-analysis investigated parameters independently associated with elevated CBFv. Receiver operating characteristic(ROC-)curve analysis was undertaken to identify the best cut-off for NLR to discriminate between increased CBFv. 108 patients with CABM were identified. 27.8% (30/108) showed elevated CBFv. Patients with elevated CBFv and normal CBFv, respectively had a worse clinical status on admission (Glasgow Coma Scale: 12 [9–14] vs. 14 [11–15]; p = 0.005) and required more often intensive care (30/30 [100.0%] vs. 63/78 [80.8%]; p = 0.01).The causative pathogen was S. pneumoniae in 70%. Patients with elevated CBFv developed more often cerebrovascular complications with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) within hospital stay (p = 0.031). A significantly higher admission-NLR was observed in patients with elevated CBFv (median [IQR]: elevated CBFv:24.0 [20.4–30.2] vs. normal CBFv:13.5 [8.4–19.5]; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis, revealed NLR to be significantly associated with increased CBFv (Odds ratio [95%CI] 1.042 [1.003–1.084]; p = 0.036). ROC-analysis identified a NLR of 20.9 as best cut-off value to discriminate between elevated CBFv (AUC = 0.713, p < 0.0001, Youden's Index = 0.441;elevated CBFv: NLR ≥ 20.9 19/30[63.5%] vs. normal CBFv: NLR > 20.9 15/78[19.2%]; p < 0.001). Intracranial vascular complications are common among CABM-patients and are a risk factor for unfavorable outcome at discharge. Elevated NLR is independently associated with high CBFv and may be useful in predicting patients’ prognosis."}

En vue d’une cure chirurgicale pour hernie, un bilan préopératoire comportant un groupage sanguin est prescrit à Mr X. Lors de la réalisation de ce bilan en laboratoire de ville, bien que Mr X ait précisé qu’il avait été AG et possédait une carte post-AG, les 2 prélèvements pour groupage sont réalisés considérant que sa carte post-AG n’est plus valide. Une carte de groupe « standard » lui est donc remise sans CT. Préoccupé par cette carte, Mr X contacte son médecin hématologue. Ce dernier informe immédiatement le laboratoire de son erreur et prévient le chirurgien allant prendre en charge Mr X. La nouvelle carte de groupe est finalement détruite. À la suite de ce signalement une déclaration d’IG a été faite. Une enquête avec analyse systémique a été réalisée au sein du laboratoire et a mené à la mise en place de plusieurs actions, notamment une sensibilisation du personnel à ces cas particuliers. Cet incident, non isolé, montre à quel point l’éducation thérapeutique du patient AG a toute son importance plaçant ce dernier comme acteur de sa prise en charge notamment lors des relais ville/hôpital.

H. pylori is a neutralophile that has developed special acid acclimation mechanisms to colonize its acidic gastric niche. Identifying the components of these mechanisms will provide novel bactericidal drug targets. Alternatively, better 24-hour acid control would increase the efficacy of antibiotics, leading to dual therapy with improved PPIs and amoxicillin. Studies of acid acclimation by H. pylori have identified several potential eradication targets including UreI, α-carbonic anhydrase, and a two-component system.

The emergence of periodontal tissue engineering for clinical treatment of periodontal disease has opened a new therapeutic avenue. The choice of scaffold is crucial. This study was conducted to prepare zein scaffold and explore the suitability of zein and Shuanghuangbu for periodontal tissue engineering. A zein scaffold was made using the solvent casting/particulate leaching method with sodium chloride (NaCl) particles as the porogen. The physical properties of the zein scaffold were evaluated by observing its shape and determining its pore structure and porosity. Cytotoxicity testing of the scaffold was carried out via in vitro cell culture experiments, including a liquid extraction experiment and the direct contact assay. Also, the Chinese medicine Shuanghuangbu, as a growth factor, was diluted by scaffold extract into different concentrations. This Shuanghuangbu‐scaffold extract was then added to periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) in order to determine its effect on cell proliferation. The zein scaffold displayed a sponge‐like structure with a high porosity and sufficient thickness. The porosity and pore size of the zein scaffold can be controlled by changing the porogen particles dosage and size. The porosity was up to 64.1%–78.0%. The pores were well‐distributed, interconnected, and porous. The toxicity of the zein scaffold was graded as 0–1. Furthermore, PDLCs displayed full stretching and vigorous growth under scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Shuanghuangbu‐scaffold extract could reinforce proliferation activity of PDLCs compared to the control group, especially at 100 μg·mL−1 (P<0.01). A zein scaffold with high porosity, open pore wall structure, and good biocompatibility is conducive to the growth of PDLCs. Zein could be used as scaffold to repair periodontal tissue defects. Also, Shuanghuangbu‐scaffold extract can enhance the proliferation activity of PDLCs. Altogether, these findings provide the basis for in vivo testing on animals."}

Indeed, when undertaking a proteomic study, the production of a suitable cellular extract is essential. Further isolation of subcellular fractions depends on the ability to rupture the animal tissues in such a manner that the organelle or macromolecule of interest can be purified in a high yield, free from contaminants and in an active form. The homogenization technique employed should, therefore, stress the cells sufficiently enough to cause the surface plasma membrane to rupture, thus releasing the cytosol; however, it should not cause extensive damage to the subcellular structures, organelles, and membrane vesicles. The extraction of proteins from animal tissues is relatively straightforward, as animal cells are enclosed only by a surface plasma membrane (also referred to as the limiting membrane or cell envelope) that is only weakly held by the cytoskeleton. They are relatively fragile compared to the rigid cell walls of many bacteria and all plants and are thus susceptible to shear forces. Animal tissues can be crudely divided into soft muscle (e.g., liver and kidney) or hard muscle (e.g., skeletal and cardiac). Reasonably gentle mechanical forces such as those produced by liquid shear may disrupt the soft tissues, whereas the hard tissues require strong mechanical shear forces provided by blenders and mincers. The homogenate produced by these disruptive methods is then centrifuged in order to remove the remaining cell debris."}

All children younger than 15 years, with  first time VP shunting, at a tertiary government hospital in Kathmandu during 2014-2017 were followed up. Association of independent variables with the primary outcome variable (complication of VP shunt) was analyzed using Chi-square test. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to identify unadjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Multivariate logistic regression model was designed to calculate adjusted OR with 95% CI. <bi>Results:</bi> Of 120 patients, more than half (55.8%) of the patients were male. Mean age was 62.97 months. Maximum duration of follow-up was 30 months. Most common cause of hydrocephalus was congenital aqueductal stenosis (40.8%) followed by tumors (29.2%). Overall shunt complication was found in 26.7% (95% CI 19.0%–35.5%). Shunt infection was seen in 5% while malfunction without infection was found in 21.7%. Bivariate logistic regression showed duration of surgery more than 1 h (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.11–6.42, P = 0.028) compared to 1 h or less, experienced surgeon (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16–0.89, P = 0.026) compared to residents, and emergency surgery (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.69–9.29, P = 0.001) compared to elective surgery as significant risk factors, while emergency surgery was the only significant variable for shunt failure on multivariate regression analysis (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.16–9.35, P = 0.025). <bi>Conclusion:</bi> Longer duration of surgery, less experience of the surgeon, and the priority of the case (emergency) were independent risk factors for shunt complications.</p>"}

Here, we describe a green approach to fabricate genipin crosslinked chitosan-kappa-carrageenan composite hydrogels (C-K hydrogels) aiming at reducing endotoxin level and bacteria burden in septic blood synchronously. The chemical compositions and morphologies of the developed C-K hydrogels were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The C-K hydrogels significantly inhibited adverse blood-material interactions such as hemolysis, complement activation, platelet activation and contact activation, and exhibited better anticoagulant properties than raw chitosan hydrogels. Most importantly, the optimized C 2 -K 1 hydrogels were competent to eliminate 63.3 % of endotoxin in septic blood with a maximum adsorption capacity of 95.0 EU/g during a 3-h simulative hemoperfusion procedure. Bacteria cleansing experiments further demonstrated that the optimized C 2 -K 1 hydrogels effectively decreased 46.0 % of E. coli and 68.7 % of S. aureus load, respectively. It is believed that the C-K hydrogels are promising hemoperfusion sorbents to treat severe septic patients."}

On these surfaces the segment of the cross section that supports the load at the instant of rupture is seen distinctly, and its area can be measured. Normalizing breaking load by this area provides a breaking stress characteristic of the final supporting segment. “Ultimate” breaking stresses calculated in this way indicate (i) For notched filaments, the ultimate breaking stress is almost constant with notch depth and also with strain rate. (ii) For un-notched filaments, there is an increase of breaking load with strain rate, due in part to the extent of the slow cleavage that precedes failure; however, the ultimate breaking stress increases as rate of strain decreases. These two findings are incompatible with mechanisms of failure based on growth of microcracks by heat- and stress-activated chain breakage. A possible explanation involves rearrangement of microfibrils within the fiber which alters their strength distribution. (iii) The apparent strength reduction on wetting nylon filaments in water is due to a faster rate of growth of the slow-cleavage area; the ultimate breaking stress is unchanged, except at high rates of strain."}

Studies showed that GE possesses anti-neoplastic, anti-tumor, anti-helminthic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Herein, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of GE in a mouse model of hypoxia-induced amnesia. Mice were exposed to hypoxic conditions (10% O2) in a designated hypoxia chamber and co-treated with GE (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. Following this, behavioral tests were performed to evaluate memory performance. We assessed microglial activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) regions by evaluating the Iba-1 and GFAP transcript levels, and MIP-1β, Cox-2, and IL6 protein levels. Apoptosis was assessed by evaluating Bax, BAD, and Bcl-2 mRNA levels, and caspase-3 activity. To uncover the underlying molecular mechanism, we evaluated the levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 in different brain regions of mice from all groups. Results showed that hypoxia-exposed mice have reduced performance in the behavioral tests and GE treatment enhanced the memory performance in hypoxia-exposed mice. Moreover, hypoxia-exposed mice showed increased expression of microglial activation markers and enhanced apoptosis in the hippocampus, amygdala, and PFC. GE treatment suppressed microglial activation and prevented apoptosis in the brain of hypoxia-exposed mice. Furthermore, hypoxia-exposure reduced the expression of Nrf2, NQO1, and HO-1 while GE treatment ameliorated this decrease in different regions of hypoxia-exposed mice brain. In conclusion, GE prevents cognitive dysfunction by suppressing microglial activation and inhibiting apoptosis in the hypoxia-exposed mice brain.\n"}

As the initial presentation with gut tumors may often be acute, with hemorrhage or intussusception, for example, requiring immediate surgical intervention, the surgeon is in a prime position to make the initial diagnosis of such conditions. A clear grasp of the various entities that can arise in childhood with their associations and concomitant risks of long-term malignancy is therefore essential for excellence in surgical practice."}

It combines an acute injury to a previously normal liver, with the development of progressive encephalopathy, coagulopathy, jaundice, and a potential deterioration to multi-organ failure. Paracetamol-induced liver injury and viral hepatitis are the major causes of ALF. However, unknown origin remains frequent. Management of ALF includes a etiological diagnostic procedure to recognize etiologies deserving an early and specific treatment such as N-acetylcysteine. In addition, aggressive symptomatic management addresses consequences of liver injury-related systemic manifestations such as cerebral edema, cardiovascular collapse and lung or kidney injury. The place for extracorporeal liver supports is still a matter of debate and liver transplantation often remains the only effective treatment for patients with advanced disease. Although the introduction of emergency transplantation has transformed the prognosis of ALF, survival rates are still less than for elective liver transplantation. Recognizing indications for transplantation is based on prognostic scores but remains challenging. Management of patients with severe ALF is best performed in specialized centers by a multi-disciplinary team associating hepatologist, intensivist and transplant surgeon."}

IM grading by endoscopic images is essential to reduce the risk and mortality of gastric cancer. However, expensive and time-consuming manual annotations result in insufficient endoscopic image datasets to support the training of deep learning models. Prototypical network is the foundational model in few-shot learning and routinely is used to overcome insufficient datasets. Therefore, we propose an improved prototypical network (PN-ViT) for endoscopic grading of intestinal metaplasia. Firstly, the original IM dataset is divided into support sets and query sets, where the support set images are used to calculate prototypes and the images are only used to extract features in the query set. Second, a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) is used as an embedding layer to extract IM lesion features from support sets. Then, the average value of features is calculated as the prototype of each category. Third, the features of the query set images are extracted using the pre-trained ViT as well. After the distances between them and prototypes are calculated for predicting the category. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on a private intestinal metaplasia grading dataset from a Grade-A tertiary hospital. Experimental results showed that PN-ViT achieved the top classification accuracy of 70.2% in 3-way 5-shot scenario and verified the effectiveness of PN-ViT."}

Commission government originated in Galveston, Texas, where business leaders conceived the plan as a temporary measure to speed recovery from the great hurricane of 1900. Other cities in Texas and across the nation soon followed; by 1920, about 500 municipalities had adopted the plan in which elected representatives serve as heads of city departments and, collectively, as a policy-making body. Beginning with Galveston and Houston and Des Moines, Iowa, Bradley Robert Rice presents detailed case studies of the earliest commission cities and shows how the plan was developed and modified to suit each community’s needs. He goes on to chronicle the adoption of the commission plan by other cities across the country that strove for “businesslike efficiency” as a reaction against corruption and machine politics in urban government. Most commission charters included a wide-ranging package of municipal reforms, such as the short ballot, at-large representation, nonpartisanship, civil service, and direct legislation. Yet Rice shows that the commission plan generally offered little in the way of social reform to accompany its reorganization of municipal government. Applying a model of innovation diffusion, the author analyzes how and why the new form of city government spread across Progressive Era America. He also thoroughly explores the relationship between the commission plan and other Progressive Era reforms and reports on the reasons for its decline from both a social and a practical perspective. Progressive Cities is described by Professor Bruce M. Stave, editor of the Journal of Urban History, as “a sound piece of work which should make a useful and worthwhile contribution to the existing scholarship on urban reform and should appeal to an audience which cuts across disciplines: history, political science, urban studies and urban planning.”"}

While the party’s defeat could be ascribed to conventional factors, including narratives of elite corruption linked to its leadership and internal factionalism; however, another significant factor that contributed to UMNO’s remarkable downfall was the cleavage structure that shifted away from the party which therefore eroded their political support. The article seeks to demonstrate the erosion of UMNO’s influence among the Malay electorates, particularly in its traditional strongholds of rural parliamentary constituencies in Peninsular Malaysia due to modifications in the cleavage structure. The analysis of the 2013, 2018, and 2022 general elections indicated&nbsp;that UMNO ceded votes to the Islamic party, PAS and the&nbsp;newly formed Malay party, BERSATU, which were partners of the Pakatan Harapan opposition coalition in 2018.&nbsp;The outcomes of the 2022 general elections revealed&nbsp;a further decline in support for UMNO among Malay electorates, attributed to the merger between&nbsp;PAS and BERSATU, to establish&nbsp;a perceived Malay-Muslim coalition in&nbsp;Perikatan Nasional. This article argues that UMNO lost its monopoly among the Malay electorates due to the strengthened convergence between the two cleavage structures of ethnicity and religion. The convergence was facilitated by UMNO's promotion of Islamisation, its normalisation of political cooperation with PAS, and the party’s inability to compete effectively with BERSATU which ended UMNO’s one-party dominance in Malaysia."}

This simulator development refers to an empirical interpretive approach following the pragmatism view. This approach involves the construction of the dedicated simulator by interpreting insights and document analysis relevant to the stakeholders in the respective emergency plan in order to plan and manage responses to emergencies and disasters. Dedicated process models (overall process map and workflow diagram) explain that, those organisations unable to define and identify the disaster coordinator roles and responsibilities, resources and equipment may contribute 65.63 % of emergency plan disorder and severe calamities. Those models are able to materialise the structure of a simulation workflow in order to demonstrate in training the emergency response prerequisites rather than intervention principles alone. It is likely that, this approach is significantly useful and justifies a mixture of tacit and explicit knowledge among the emergency plan experts. Therefore, a strategic, simplified and prevailing radiation and nuclear emergency plan simulator can be attained, though it is certainly as complex."}

Captive breeding has often been claimed to be a useful tool in preservation of biodiversity. The role of zoos in conservation work and the value of captive breeding are discussed; the latter exemplified by the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) Programme and the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) Programme. Captive breeding programmes are very resource demanding and can only be afforded for a very small number of species, which limits their value significantly. Zoos deal mainly with vertebrates, but these comprise less than 3% of the described species, and although the 878 zoos considered hold more than 20 000 specimens of 140 threatened mammal species, they probably only contribute to the conservation of 20 full species. The situation for birds, reptiles and amphibians is even worse. Zoos face serious problems with minimum viable population sizes and hybridization. However, zoos can make a major contribution to preservation of biodiversity through educating and informing the public. Today, where the crisis of extinction of species has reached such daunting dimensions, captive breeding and otherex situ conservation tools should be the last resort for preserving biodiversity, and captive breeding must not become an excuse to avoid dealing with preservation of habitats."}

An oligonucleotide from this region of the TERT promoter bound to proteins in a nuclear extract prepared from a mouse hepatoma cell line. These proteins were identified as NF-κB by a number of criteria: 1) the protein complex formed on the TERT oligonucleotide had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that formed on an NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide; 2) protein binding to this site was enhanced by NF-κB activators tumor necrosis factor-α, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and interleukin-1β; and 3) the complex was specific and could be supershifted with antibodies against the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits. The NF-κB binding site from the mouse TERT promoter activated transcription when fused to a basal SV40 promoter and enhanced the activity of the native TERT promoter in mouse hepatoma cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Transcriptional activation by the TERT NF-κB site could also be enhanced by co-transfection with an NF-κB1 expression vector.

Currently, remote sensing images are stored in the local FTP Server of each department, which is difficult for users to manage, discover and share them. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to archive remote sensing images online. The remote sensing image files are transmitted from client end to the FTP server based on an ActiveX control installed on the Web browser. Meanwhile, the metadata for remote sensing images will be extracted and stored into the metadata repository using Grid Service. Based on these metadata, we developed an integration platform to publish and share the remote sensing images on the Web. The experiments show that ActiveX control increases the archiving speed and decreases the burden of the Web server remarkably."}

This work focuses on the development, implementation, and validation of a constitutive model for unidirectional composites, aiming to numerically simulate impact damage in laminated structures. The model incorporates a failure criterion that accounts for the influence of strain rate on failure initiation and distinguishes between four failure modes. Failure initiation criteria are 3D phenomenological-based criteria according to the previous work of Puck and Schürmann (1998) and Pinho (2006). Additionally, a mesh-objective damage propagation model is implemented to simulate the impact damage. The impact simulations are performed using Abaqus/Explicit, with the constitutive model implemented through the user subroutine VUMAT. Validation of the strain rate effects on failure initiation is performed using strain rate-dependent bi-axial failure curves for IM7/8552 and AS-4/3506. The analyses indicate that the properties governing the strain rate dependence of failure initiation are consistent. Therefore, the hypothesis was tested in which the same strain rate scaling approach could be used for CFRP materials for which only static properties are available. This hypothesis was tested in high and low-velocity impact simulations at laminated IMS60/977–2 CFRP plates. The results demonstrate that the model accurately replicates the experimentally observed impact-induced contact forces and effectively captures the damaged state in the impacted plate."}

Although Galectins are also highly expressed intracellularly, their cytosolic functions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of Galectin-9 in dendritic cell (DC) surface organisation and function. By combining functional, super-resolution and atomic force microscopy experiments to analyse membrane stiffness, we identified intracellular Galectin-9 to be indispensable for plasma membrane integrity and structure in DCs. Galectin-9 knockdown studies revealed intracellular Galectin-9 to directly control cortical membrane structure via modulating Rac1 activity, providing the underlying mechanism of Galectin-9-dependent actin cytoskeleton organisation. Consequent to its role in maintaining plasma membrane structure, phagocytosis studies revealed that Galectin-9 was essential for C-type lectin receptor-mediated pathogen uptake by human DCs. This was confirmed by the impaired phagocytic capacity of Galectin-9-null murine DCs. Together, this study demonstrates a novel role for intracellular Galectin-9 in modulating DC function, which may be evolutionary conserved. "}

In this study, a DNA vaccine encoding two major surface antigens SAG1, SAG3 from T. gondii, with A2/B subunit of cholera toxin as a genetic adjuvant was constructed. BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with PBS, pcDNA3.1, pSAG1, pSAG1/SAG3 and pSAG1/SAG3-CTXA2/B three times separately. Immunized mice were tested for IgG antibody and IFN-γ and IL-4 production by ELISA. The proliferation of T cells was measured by DNA synthesis assay and the lymphocyte subsets of spleen cells by flow cytometry. All the immunized mice were challenged with 103 highly virulent RH tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii intraperitoneally and the survival times were recorded. An enhanced production of IgG antibodies, antigen-specific lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-γ production from splenic cells were induced in mice immunized with pSAG1/SAG3 compared to mice immunized with pSAG1 (P<0.05). Introduction of CTXA2/B further enhanced the Th1 cell-mediated immunity with higher levels of IFN-γ, lymphocyte proliferation activity and percentage of CD8+ T-cells. When challenged with lethal doses of T. gondii (1×103), all control mice (PBS and empty plasmid group) died within 6 days. Mice immunized with pSAG1 died within 8 days. While 20% and 40% survival rate were achieved from mice immunized with pSAG1/SAG3 and pSAG1/SAG3-CTXA2/B. This study indicates the compound DNA vaccine encoding T. gondii antigens SAG1, SAG3 with CTXA2/B gene was a promising DNA vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis, which could effectively enhance the humoral and cellular immune response and prolong survival time in vaccinated mice."}

General knowledge that is useful for anti-corruption policies must be applied according to the specific circumstances in each case. The social contract approach necessitates a dialogue between those who are doing basic research and those who are area or country specialists. Taking inspiration from military theorist Basil Liddell Hart’s indirect approach strategy, it is argued that decision makers should focus on policies that can change the basic social contract, instead of relying solely on measures that are intended to change incentives for corrupt actors. The indirect approach does not emphasize any single instrument, instead, the means depend on the case at hand. The main goal for the indirect approach is to change the opponent’s psychological willingness to resist change."}

Employment related stressors impact trans* people across the transition spectrum, as they decide whether an organization is a safe environment to transition prior to transition and navigate confusing and often oppressive organizational policies and practices during transition. Ultimately, negative workplace experiences lead to disruptions in the formation and maintenance of social networks, which are integral to occupational attainment and success. For example, many trans* people are forced to decide whether to reveal their trans* gender identity or lose prior employment histories that are not congruent with their current gender identity. Others lose opportunities for mentorship and social connections because of assumed interactions between sex category and gender identity and homophily. At each stage of the transition process (pre-transition, during transition, and post-transition), organizations have opportunities to demonstrate proactive inclusion, potentially improving workplace experiences. This chapter reviews current theory, US research and laws related to trans* people’s workplace experiences, and offers recommendations that workplaces can adopt to improve the lives of trans* persons. Some recommendations include adopting a non-discrimination policy that includes gender identity and gender expression, establishing organizational guidelines for transition that are tailored to an individual’s needs, and explicit commitment to non-discriminatory hiring practices."}

Damage control surgery (DCS) as a concept exists for over one hundred years but has been more widely optimized and implemented over the past few decades. Minimizing the time from the trauma scene to the hospital and recognizing the patterns of injury and the “lethal triad” (acidosis, hypothermia, coagulopathy) is vital to understand which patients will benefit the most from DCS. Immediate patient resuscitation, massive blood transfusion, and taking the patient to the operating room as soon as possible are the critical initial steps that have been associated with improved outcomes. Bleeding and contamination control should be the priority in this first exploratory laparotomy, while the patient should be transferred to the intensive care unit postoperatively with only temporary abdominal wall closure. Once the patient is stabilized, a second operation should be performed where an anatomic liver resection or other more major procedures may take place, along with permanent closure of the abdominal wall."}

However, the applications of this type of biosensor are greatly limited due to their unsatisfactory sensitivity. In this work, a magnetic-sensitized (MS) mechanical biosensor based on multi-field coupling was developed for higher sensitivity, giving access to detect human serum albumin (HSA). Via introducing secondary magnetic antibodies labeled with magnetized Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles to the stress and electrical conversion element of the MS-biosensor, the multi-field coupling was realized based on stress, electricity, and magnetism . Under the action of the magnetic field , the magnetic force of the secondary magnetic antibody and the stress of antigen-antibody binding jointly drove and enhanced the deformation of the MS-biosensor, amplifying the electrical signal, and realizing magnetic sensitization. The HSA was detected by the MS-biosensor at a range of 0–80 μg/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.14 μg/mL, demonstrating the high performance of the MS-biosensor. Moreover, the MS-biosensor showed high selectivity , specificity, and stability, indicating that the magnetic sensitization strategy of the MS-biosensor was significant for the clinical application of mechanical biosensors. • Via modifying the secondary magnetic antibody, the sensitivity of the biosensor was improved. • The biosensor completed the high-quality analysis of human serum albumin. • The biosensor enabled the accurate detection of human serum albumin in urine from clinical samples."}

Very less number of qualified hydro-geosites clearly reveals that most of them are in pathetic stage due to their negligence since long time that needs urgent conservation.

The gas antisolvent (GAS) process is one of the promising techniques and has been applied to many applications. However, control of the GAS process is a quite challenging problem and has not yet been studied due to the complex liquid–vapor equilibrium and particle formation kinetics. This work proposes a batch-wise nonlinear model predictive control (BNMPC) approach to the GAS process to obtain the desired particle size distribution (PSD) of HMX, a widely used explosive, which should be small and uniform for stability. Although a dynamic model of the GAS crystallization is required for BNMPC, the previously developed model is too complex for real-time applications. We propose a model simplification strategy for the conventional model using experimental data. We also employ a high-resolution method (HRM) to solve effectively a partial differential equation (PDE). The simulation results show that BNMPC can produce more uniform and smaller HMX particles."}

The cleanness and size of the 3D dark spot, the uniformity and strength of the light shell surrounding the dark spot, and the light efficiency all depend on the truncation parameter β of the R-LG11 beam and the numerical aperture (NA) of the system. When β=1.6 and the NA is close to its utmost, an almost 100% uniform light shell surrounding the 3D dark spot can be achieved and the dark spot is very clean. If the NA is lowered but β is increased to 1.95, we can also achieve an almost 100% uniform light shell and light efficiency can reach 90%, but the disadvantage is that the center of the dark spot is not too clean. A not-too-clean 3D dark spot, if the light shell surrounding it is very uniform, is acceptable for many applications. Therefore, 3D dark spots surrounded by a high uniform light shell, generated by simply adjusting the truncation parameter of the R-LG11 beam and the NA of the system, are useful for superresolution fluorescence microscopy, dark spot microscopy, and the dark spot trap."}

The pyrolysis mechanism of pure HFO-1234yf and R32 is investigated by ReaxFF molecular dynamics simulation(MD) and density function theory (DFT) calculation. There are 15 initiation reaction pathways observed in the process of pyrolysis. The pyrolysis processes of mixed working fluid (HFO-1234yf/R32) are carried out at different temperatures and different ratios of mixture. The results show that R32 can restrain the decomposition of HFO-1234yf at 2600 K–2800 K and promote one of HFO-1234yf after 3000 K. This is also demonstrated by the kinetic analysis. The radical CHF2 from the decomposition of R32 plays a significant role and can obviously decrease the energy barrier of all the decomposition pathways of HFO-1234yf after 3000 K based on the analysis of DFT. HF is the dominant product in the all pyrolysis processes. In the mixture, R32 slows down the formation of HF at 2600 K–3100 K, but increase the quantity of HF at 3200–3500 K."}

Through their stories from daily life, this chapter attempts to explicate migrant workers’ mobile phone usage against a background of their alienated situation in Beijing. The author explores the responses of the migrants toward their situation in relation to the social usage of mobile phone and specifically introduces and discusses four concepts for understanding patterns of migrant mobile phone use: feigned presence, concern in absence, jianghu relations, and romantic relations. This chapter ends with a conclusion that the patterns of mobile phone uses contribute to the change of migrant workers’ way of life. Remaining problems and future research avenues implied in this study are also discussed."}

With a state-of-the-art method based on local diffusion MR properties for automated subdivision of the thalamus, we first restrain the region of interest to the group of motor-related nuclei. Then, this thalamic part is further subdivided, in graph parcellation manner, using the intensity-related features provided by SWI together with prior knowledge of the Vim localization inside the motor thalamic segment. Our framework was tested in four healthy elderly subjects, for eight thalami in total, and the results were evaluated by an experienced neurosurgeon, showing the ability to directly detect the Vim area. The qualitative inspection indicated that the proposed method outperforms standard multi-atlas based techniques.\n"}

Comparison of the average degree of consolidation defined by pore pressure with that defined by settlement shows that they are different and the maximum difference is 22.8%.

In greenhouse tests, mechanically inoculated plants of Cucurbita pepo (Small Sugar pumpkin and Early Prolific Straightneck squash) and watermelon (Crimson Sweet) developed mosaic or mottle symptoms. Isolate 2932 caused foliar symptoms in 16 cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, including Freedom II and Prelude II, and in six cultivars of watermelon. None of five cultivars of melon (Cucumis melo) or 11 cultivars of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) developed consistent, distinctive symptoms, but all of these cultivars were systemically infected based on back-inoculations to squash. No systemic infection of mechanically inoculated plants of 25 species representing 13 noncucurbitaceous plant families was detected. Crystalline nuclear inclusions, cytoplasmic amorphous inclusions, and cytoplasmic cylindrical inclusions were detected by light and electron microscopy in leaf tissues of infected squash and watermelon. Electron microscopy of squash leaf extracts revealed filamentous particles, and 86% of 159 particles measured ranged from 800 to 890 nm in length. The virus was transmitted in a nonpersistent manner by Myzus persicae from squash to squash in two of three trials. Immunodiffusion tests with polyclonal antisera prepared to partially purified 2932 or its capsid protein showed that the isolate was antigenically different from papaya ringspot virus type W, watermelon mosaic virus 2, and zucchini yellow mosaic virus. In limited testing of field samples of squash and watermelon since 1990, no additional isolates of the 2932 type have been found. The characteristics of isolate 2932 obtained thus far indicate that it is a distinct potyvirus. It is tentatively named watermelon leaf mottle virus to distinguish it from other potyviruses commonly isolated from cucurbits in Florida."}

Minimally invasive approaches, notably laparoscopic and robotic techniques, have gained increasing acceptance. This network meta-analysis aimed to compare perioperative outcomes of open, laparoscopic, and robotic distal pancreatectomy. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus identified studies comparing at least two approaches. Both Bayesian and frequentist network meta-analyses were conducted. Results: Sixty-seven studies including 18,113 patients met inclusion criteria. Surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) analysis showed robotic surgery ranked first in 84.6% of measured parameters, accumulating 92.3% of total points. Laparoscopy showed intermediate results, while open surgery ranked lowest. Robotic, but not laparoscopic, surgery significantly reduced 30-day mortality (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.37, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.16–0.84) and lowered conversion rates compared with laparoscopy (OR = 0.30, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] 0.22–0.40). Both robotic and laparoscopic approaches, compared with open surgery, were associated with reduced blood loss (-304 mL and -273 mL), fewer transfusions (OR 0.25 and 0.30), smaller transfused volumes (-1.98 and -1.86 units), shorter ICU stays (-4.0 and -2.3 days), fewer reinterventions (OR 0.45 and 0.56), and shorter hospital stays (-8.8 and -6.9 days). Conclusions: Robotic distal pancreatectomy appears safe and confers significant advantages over open and laparoscopic surgery, including reduced 30-day mortality, lower conversion rates, and improved perioperative outcomes, when performed in appropriately equipped, high-volume settings."}

Towards the deeper regions of Almirante Câmara canyon and in the adjacent slope area, the lower abundance, diversity, and richness reflect more oligotrophic conditions and an adverse environment in terms of easily metabolizable organic matter.

It seems that swing of ancient times spread across the country after customs from nomadic tribes of the northern regions of China in the Warring States Period were passed on to central areas through the Qi state. As it reached Middle Age society, swing made their appearance as visual amusement for the emperor and honors of the royal court and as art of high quality was added, it was presented extravagantly. In particular, swing aspects of the Song Dynasty Era were not those of the single event swing shown in ancient societies, but part of song, dance, leisure, and performance. In pre-modern societies(the Ming and Qing Dynasties), swing were further popularized and homes installed pillars for swing regardless of wealth or region and enjoyed them. Also, with the inflow of Western swing, arts of high degrees of difficulty were demanded and swing that were traditional amusements of the Qīngmíng Festival became more than traditional amusements and transitioned into something that could be enjoyed even on days that were not holidays.BR  With the coming of modern society, swing transitioned from traditional amusement to sports events. In this process, ethnic Koreans living in China making efforts to pass on the traditional form of amusement, traditional athletics competitions of minority groups, and national efforts helped swing to be passed on and developed. Today, as social demand for the continuance of traditional culture is becoming greater, the fact that swing have continued in their existence from China until now implies many things. Also, it is hoped that this will be a foundation for future studies that discover similarities in amusements of Northeast Asian countries and that search for the significance of such exchange aspects."}

Most systematic studies of this thesis investigate whether recombination is associated with the creation of high-impact technologies. This study looks at novelty in markets, investigating the association between recombination and venture capital investment. Acknowledging that people use different categories in different contexts, the author argues that the evaluator’s categorical system is foundational to what is recognized and rewarded as recombination. Supporting this view, findings show that venture capitalists are more likely to invest in software entrepreneurs that engage in recombination across market categories, but standard measures of recombination across technological categories (based on patent classes) are not associated with investment. In addition, whether a person values recombination depends on his orientation toward disrupting the status quo. In line with this, it is high and low status VCs who are more likely to invest in firms that engage in recombination. In syndicates comprised of middle status investors only, the direction of the effect reverses. Findings suggest that the evaluator role is fundamental to the concept of recombination and the construal of novelty in a domain."}

Due to their high reactivity, they are envisioned as potential reducing agents of a number of pollutants such as nitrate, chromate, or selenate. The interaction of selenate ions with such iron(II)-containing hydroxy compounds was studied by monitoring the oxidation processes of the iron phases with transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy measured at 14 K and by following the evolution of Se(VI) in solution by capillary electrophoresis. This interaction involved the hydroxy-selenate green rust, a compound isomorphous to the hydroxy-sulfate GR(SO42-). Its chemical composition, FeIIyFeIII2(OH)2(y+2)SeO4·8H2O, varied with time since y starts at 5.5 and ends at 4.

Finally, the hydroxy-selenate GR2(SeO42-) can form without any other oxidizing agent than selenate itself."}

The model has a thermodynamic basis, is related to recently developed mixture models, and is capable of providing a detailed description of tumor progression. It utilizes a diffuse interface approach, whereby sharp tumor boundaries are replaced by narrow transition layers that arise due to differential adhesive forces among the cell-species. The model consists of fourth-order nonlinear advection–reaction–diffusion equations (of Cahn–Hilliard-type) for the cell-species coupled with reaction–diffusion equations for the substrate components. Computing numerical solutions of the model is challenging because the equations are coupled, highly nonlinear, and numerically stiff. In this paper we describe a fully adaptive, nonlinear multigrid/finite difference method for efficiently solving the equations. We demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm and we present simulations of tumor growth in 2D and 3D that demonstrate the capabilities of the algorithm in accurately and efficiently simulating the progression of tumors with complex morphologies."}

To this end, 20 rats (Wistar) were intraperitoneally inoculated with blood containing trypomastigotes 10 6 (Group T) and 12 animals were used as negative control (Group C) and received saline (0.2 mL) through same route. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture on day 5 (C5, T5) and 30 (C30, T30) post-inoculation (pi) to perform complete blood count and determination of serum iron, transferrin, ferritin , total and latent iron fixation capacity, transferrin saturation and prohepcidin concentration. Also, bone marrow samples were collected, to perform Pearls staining reaction. Levels of iron, total and latent iron binding capacity and prohepcidin concentration were lower ( P < 0.05) in infected rats (T5 and T30 groups) compared to controls. On the other hand, levels of transferrin and ferritin were higher when compared to controls ( P < 0.05). The transferrin saturation increased on day 5 pi, but decreased on day 30 pi. The Pearls reaction showed a higher accumulation of iron in the bone marrow of infected animals in day 5 pi ( P < 0.01). Infection with T. evansi in rats caused anemia and changes in iron metabolism associated to the peaks of parasitemia. These results suggest that changes in iron metabolism may be related to the host immune response to infection and anemic status of infected animals."}

Furthermore, we also investigate these sectors’ efficiency and multifractality during the global financial crisis (GFC) to analyze the features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings can be summarized as follows. First, the average return series show non-persistent and persistent features during the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Second, during each of these crisis periods, the consumer discretionary and utilities sectors had the highest and lowest levels of efficiency, respectively. Third, while both long-range correlations and fat-tailed distribution contributed to the multifractal properties, the latter of these was the chief contributor. Furthermore, the lower the efficiency ranking, the greater the impact of the fat-tailed distribution on multifractality. Finally, we classify sectors with low market efficiency for the two crisis periods. These findings have several important implications for asset allocations by investors in US stock markets. • We test the EMH for a number of industries in the US stock market during COVID-19. • We also investigate their efficiency and multifractality during the GFC. • The CD and UTI sectors have the highest and lowest efficiency, respectively. • The fat-tailed distribution had a greater impact than on the long-range correlation. • We classify sectors with low market efficiency for the two crisis periods."}

Therefore, it is thought that natural dye is a good substitute for environmentally friendly textile coloration and manufacturing. In the present investigation, we used turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) extract to dye viscose garments. To increase the total uptake of dyes into the innermost regions of the fabric, pre-treatments with natural mordants (derived from Citrus lemon and vinegar) and chemical mordants (Potassium hydroxide and Sodium carbonate) were also conducted. The resultant color-strength (K/S) of the bio-mordanted pre-treatment sample was greater than the chemical mordanted sample by about 228.17%. Colorfastness of rubbing (dry and wet), washing, water, and perspiration (acidic and alkaline) tests were carried out to explore the fastness characteristics of colored fabric varieties. The results showed that natural mordants outperformed the chemical mordants. By doing so, this dyeing method suggested the possibility of using natural dyes with natural aids for viscose fabric coloring. Consequently, using extracted turmeric as a reliable dye source and a lemon as a bio-mordant could provide a beneficial insight for more environmentally friendly textile dyeing and manufacturing."}

Furthermore, the spectrogram ridge point extraction for the existing methods is limited to the assumption of the constant or close to constant frequency in local windows while many application cases may not follow this assumption.

For example, the raw signals themselves or various types of information extracted from the signals may be selected as inputs to data fusion processors. The signals, sensor data, and communications media available in a particular command-and-control system often dictate the optimum data fusion technique. This chapter addresses data fusion architectures applicable to multiple sensor and multiple target scenarios in which range information to the target is missing, but where the target location is required.\r\n\r\n10.1 Data fusion options\r\n\r\nUnambiguous target track files may be generated by using data association techniques to combine various types of passively acquired data from multiple sensors. In the examples described in this chapter, multiple ground-based radars are used to locate energy emitters, i.e., targets, by fusing either of three different types of received data: (1) received signal waveforms, (2) angle information expressing the direction to the emitters, or (3) emitter angle track data that are output from the sensors. The alternate fusion methods illustrate the difficulties and system design issues that arise in selecting the data fusion process and the type of passively acquired data to be fused.\r\n\r\nThese fusion techniques allow range information to be obtained from arrays of passive sensors that measure direction angles, or from active sensors where range information is denied (as for example when the sensor is jammed), or from combinations of passive and active sensors. For example, electronic support measure (ESM) radars can use the fused data to find the range to the emitters of interest. These fusion methods can also be used with surveillance radars that are jammed to locate the jammer positions. In a third application, angle data from a netted array of IRST sensors, or for that matter from acoustic or any passively operated sensors, can be fused to find the range to the emitters."}

Limited information exists about adherence to laboratory monitoring recommendations. The objective of this study was to describe laboratory monitoring among ambulatory patients dispensed medications for which laboratory testing is recommended at therapy initiation. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of patients in 10 geographically distributed health maintenance organizations who were newly prescribed medications with recommended laboratory test monitoring. The main outcome measure was the proportion of initial drug dispensing without recommended baseline laboratory monitoring for 35 newly initiated drugs or drug classes. RESULTS: One hundred seven thousand, seven hundred sixty-three of 279,354 (39%) initial drug dispensings occurred without recommended laboratory monitoring. Patients without monitoring were younger than patients who had monitoring (median 57 vs 61 years, P<.001). Thirty-two percent of dispensings where a serum creatinine was indicated did not have it evaluated (range across drugs, 12% to 61%); 39% did not have liver function testing (range 10% to 75%); 32% did not have hematologic monitoring (range 9% to 51%); and 34% did not have electrolyte monitoring (range 20% to 62%) (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial opportunity exists to improve laboratory monitoring of drugs for which such monitoring is recommended. This study emphasizes the need for research to identify the clinical implications of not conducting recommended laboratory monitoring, existing barriers to monitoring, and methods to improve practice."}

However, once death has occurred there is an expectation that the family will organise a funeral that reflects the character, life and personality of the deceased. Simultaneously with the disempowerment of individuals in the face of death a range of professionals has emerged, such as funeral directors and funeral officiants, who can guide families through the post-death maze, and ensure that a suitably personalised funeral is organised. This chapter suggests that the disempowerment of families in the face of bereavement is a consequence of contemporary death management practices, but that it is not a necessary consequence. Conceptualising death management as composed of two separate strands reveals spaces where families can regain control if they so wish. The first such strand is that of systems of death management, and this is composed of the requirements that a society imposes, such as death registration and certification. Those who choose to ignore such requirements do so under the threat of potentially severe consequences to themselves. The second strand is that of situated death management, and these are the processes whose flouting carries not a legal but a social consequence. The decision to hold a non-religious funeral, for example, may arouse disapproval amongst the wider kin and friendship group. The chapter illustrates how the two strands of death management may work in practice through reference to a Scottish case study."}

At present, researchers normally use the hysteresis model to build a feedforward inverse compensator to suppress the hysteresis nonlinearity. However, the existing compensator generally has the situation that the parameters do not match the reference trajectory, which cannot fully utilize the advantages of the high-precision hysteresis model. In addition, although there are a few models that can describe singular hysteresis, not all of them can well suppress the effects of it. Therefore, this paper proposes a Modified Dynamic Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MDPI) model and establishes a feedback inverse compensator capable of parameter update. Firstly, in view of the problem that the Dynamic Delay Prandtl-Ishlinskii (DDPI) model does not have an analytical inverse, we modified it and derived the expression of the MDPI model. Secondly, the accuracy of the two models is compared through experiments. Although some approximations are used in deriving the MDPI model, it can still accurately describe different hysteresis loops. Thirdly, an Analytical Inverse (A-I) compensator based on the MDPI model was established and compared with the Direct Inverse (D-I) compensator based on the DDPI model by experiment. We found that the A-I compensator has obvious advantages in suppressing the singular hysteresis. However, the trajectory compensated by the A-I compensator will deviate from the reference trajectory. Finally, the controller with parameter update function is designed to update the parameters of the compensator in real time. The simulation results show that the established feedback inverse compensator can change the internal parameters for different trajectories or external environments, and further improve the positioning accuracy of the piezoelectric actuator.

On the other hand, the geographical region of Eastern Europe/Black Sea which did not have strong economic links with the developed capitalist countries in the past failed to establish them in the current era as well.

The corresponding questions for k≥2 are open, although we are able to show some related (but weaker) results. For instance, we present an algorithm which efficiently learns shortest representations of boolean 2-CNF or 2-DNF formulas."}

The bistability manifests itself in both the mechanical frequency and linewidth under a strong microwave drive field, which simultaneously activates three different kinds of nonlinearities, namely, magnetostriction, magnon self-Kerr, and magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearities. The magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity is first predicted and measured in magnomechanics. The system enters a regime where Kerr-type nonlinearities strongly modify the conventional cavity magnomechanics that possesses only a radiation-pressure-like magnomechanical coupling. Three different kinds of nonlinearities are identified and distinguished in the experiment. Our Letter demonstrates a new mechanism for achieving mechanical bistability by combining magnetostriction and Kerr-type nonlinearities, and indicates that such Kerr-modified cavity magnomechanics provides a unique platform for studying many distinct nonlinearities in a single experiment."}

It is proved that a significant part of the explanations and methodological recommendations on fire safety during recreation in forests published in media sources do not contain the complete information necessary for tourists, do not fully comply with the current documents or even contradict them. It has been established that, in accordance with the Instructions for conducting tourist sports trekking with schoolchildren and students, the head of the educational institution or education management body that made the decision to conduct the trip is obliged to conduct targeted instruction for the leader of the tourist group and his deputy (deputies) on occupational health and safety issues during the trekking. The leader of the tourist group and his deputy (deputies) must conduct targeted training for participants and assistant leaders on occupational health and safety issues and are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with fire safety rules during the trekking. The lack of necessary qualified information and methodical materials leads to serious shortcomings in these instructions. In turn, this increases potential threats to both forest fire safety and the safety of young tourists and local lore enthusiasts."}

Patients received antituberculous treatment as per World Health Organization guidelines and were followed for 6 months. Disability was evaluated with modified Barthel index (MBI). Outcome was defined as good (MBI > 12) and poor (MBI ≤ 12). Various clinical and neuroimaging parameters, likely to affect the outcome, were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. After 6 months, 45 patients had a good outcome, while 25 patients had a poor outcome.

For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe)."}

Herein, gibberellin content and expression of GA synthesis genes were lower in Arabidopsis overexpressing ZjGRF1, 14-3-3 gene of Z. japonica, than in wild type (WT). Moreover, the expression level of GA receptors was lower in transgenic ZjGRF1 Arabidopsis than in WT. The expression level of GA response gene expansin8 (EXP8) was lower in transgenic ZjGRF1 Arabidopsis than in WT. In contrast, the expression levels of PACLOBUTRAZOL RESISTANT1 (PRE1), PRE5 and SCARECROW-LIKE 3 (SCL3) were higher in the transgenic ZjGRF1 Arabidopsis than in WT. Transgenic ZjGRF1 Arabidopsis has decreased sensitivity to paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA synthesis. The expression level of flowering regulatory genes was lower in transgenic ZjGRF1 Arabidopsis than in WT. This is the first study to report the function of 14-3-3 gene family in seagrass. These findings can be used in future studies on the regulation role of 14-3-3 gene on plant development."}

Frequency mixing serves to isolate the pure vibration signal from the omnipresent residual frequency and phase fluctuations caused by a less strictly synchronous clock, inherent characteristics of the laser and the acousto-optical modulator, and environment temperature changes. With a reduced burden on data processing, better real-time performance is achieved as well. Using probe light pulses of 4&#x00A0;kHz repetition rate and 80&#x00A0;ns pulse width, a 9&#x00A0;m spatial resolution has been achieved on a 24.6&#x00A0;km sensing fiber, with a detectable frequency range from 5&#x00A0;Hz to 1.715&#x00A0;kHz, with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 23.5&#x00A0;dB.

A retrospective cohort study was performed at a single, tertiary care pediatric hospital. Patients with AIS undergoing PSF were consecutively given a single intra-operative methadone dose and matched 1:2 to a AIS control group without methadone. Patients were matched for age, curve magnitude, levels fused, blood loss, and operating time. All children followed a standard ERAS protocol with methadone being the only change in the post-operative regimen.

The present investigation evaluates the effect of P. granatum juice (PJ) and purified punicalagin (PW) on nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and the signaling pathways leading to its expression in colon inflammation. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: positive and negative control, vehicle (50 % ethanol), standard (5-ASA 100 mg/kg, p.o.), PJ (400 mg/kg, p.o.), PW (4 mg/kg, p.o.). Colitis was induced with 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid and animals were euthanized on 18th day. Colon samples collected were subjected to various histological assessment (CMDI, DAI), and biochemical parameters (MPO, MDA, SOD, NO). Gene expression study was carried out using RT-PCR for cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-18 and NF-κβ). Pretreatment with PJ and PW significantly (p < 0.05) lowered the disease extent and severity as indicated by reduction in CMDI (2 ± 0.31) and DAI (1.83# ± 0.22) when compared with DNBS-treated rats (3.83* ± 0.17). Gene expression studies showed decreased mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-18, and IL-1β in PJ and PW-treated groups. NF-κβ mRNA levels were found to be reduced 84 and 64 % by PJ and PW, respectively. These results suggest that P. granatum juice is more biologically active over punicalagin alone and can be potentially used for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease."}

To provide an insightful basis, the channel capacity of RIS-aided MU-MIMO is theoretically analyzed. Then, the conventional transmission schemes based on orthogonal multiple access are presented as the baseline. From the information-theoretic perspective, we propose two novel schemes, i.e., \\textit{joint transmission} based on the semidefinite relaxation of quadratic optimization problems and \\textit{opportunistic transmission} relying on the best user selection. The superiority of the proposed schemes over the conventional ones in terms of achievable rates is justified through simulation results."}

In parallel, a number of drugs that have been developed to alleviate the putative key pathomechanism of ALS have been under clinical trials. Unfortunately, however, almost all studies have finished unsuccessfully. This fact indicates that the key ALS pathomechanism still remains a tough enigma. Recent studies with autopsied ALS patients and studies using mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) transgenic mice have suggested that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related toxicity may be a relevant ALS pathomechanism. Levels of ER stress-related proteins were upregulated in motor neurons in the spinal cords of ALS patients. It was also shown that mSOD1, translocated to the ER, caused ER stress in neurons in the spinal cord of mSOD1 transgenic mice. We recently reported that the newly identified ALS-causative gene, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB), plays a pivotal role in unfolded protein response (UPR), a physiological reaction against ER stress. The ALS-linked P56S mutation in VAPB nullifies the function of VAPB, resulting in motoneuronal vulnerability to ER stress. In this review, we summarize recent advances in research on the ALS pathomechanism especially addressing the putative involvement of ER stress and UPR dysfunction."}

This study investigates the energy storage performance and energy density of (Na0.2Bi0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2Ca0.2)TiO3 (NBBSCT) high-entropy ceramics synthesized via the solid-phase method at varying sintering temperatures (1100, 1150, 1200, 1250, and 1300 °C). The results show that the ceramics sintered at 1150 °C exhibit superior energy storage density, a higher dielectric constant (εr = 1907), and a lower dielectric loss (tan δ = 0.04). Specifically, the energy density was measured at 2.28 J/cm3, while the energy storage efficiency reached 70% under an applied electric field of 200 kV/cm. These findings highlight the significant impact of different sintering temperatures on the characteristics of the NBBSCT high-entropy ceramics. This study provides crucial insights that are vital for development of high-performance energy storage materials."}

The connection between them is utilised by making equivalence the basis of an argu­­ment for polyvalence within semantics, or in other terms, for a stratified semantics encompassing two levels of description. This argument from equivalence lends new support to frameworks assuming a strati­fied se­man­tics. For the argument to work properly, it is necessary to distinguish between equivalences that are facts of language and equi­valences that depend on extralinguistic circum­stances. A few other re­quire­ments for a coherent concept of equi­valence are also introduced. A major part of the article is devoted to an investiga­tion of previous accounts of equi­valence and of the conceptual underpinnings of these ac­counts. The investigation shows that all previous accounts have failed to make the necessary dis­tinction. Close examination of various cases of equivalence reveals differences that are cap­tured by the proposed dis­tinction, thus providing evidence for its ac­cu­racy. The article concludes that the argument from equi­valence strengthens the case for a stra­tified seman­tics pro­vided that the concept of equivalence has been ap­propriately delimited and defined."}

Such an analysis was conducted through text mining computational methods, including sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and topic modeling. The results revealed that although HF users employ average vocabulary diversity, they share more positive emotions, and a greater variety of emojis.

Novel dithiosemicarbazide (compound 3 ) was synthesized from dydrogesterone viadihydrazine intermediate and was well analyzed using spectroscopic methods like 1 H, 13 C NMR, FT-IR, UV-Visible spectroscopy, HRMS.Thiosemicarbazide moiety has significant medicinal importance therefore to enhance its potency and tailoring its biological activities by adding it with steroid was the basic need and rationale of this study.Quantum chemical calculations have been performed by density functional theory using B3LYP functional and 6-31G (d, p) basis set. The electronic properties and band gap energieswas analyzed by TD-DFT approach. The polarizability and hyperpolarizabilities of compound 3 indicated that it is a good candidate to be used as an NLO material. The strength and nature of intramolecular interactions have been studies using AIM approach. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and non-covalent interactions (NCI) analysis of the thiosemicarbazide product has also been carried out. Moreover, in-vitro biological activity of all the three compounds as anti-fungal agents were investigated against Fusarium solani and Alternaria alternata , and the results were compared with using MD simulation as well as docking studies. The results revealed that compound 3 has an excellent anti-fungal activity due to strong interaction stability. The physicochemical properties of all the compounds were checked through ADMET analysis to get the most bioactive compound among them with therapeutic potential."}

The sample is then dried and treated with an anhydrous acid (e.g., trifluoracetic acid), which results in cleavage of the peptide bond between the first and second amino acid. The N-terminal amino acids is therefore released as a derivative (the thiazolinone). The thiazolinone is extracted into an organic solvent, dried down, and then converted to the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative (the conversion step). The PTH amino acid is then identified, normally by reverse-phase HPLC. This is known as the direct Edman degradation and is, for example, the method used in an automated sequencing machine. The dansyl-Edman method for peptide sequencing described here is based on the Edman degradation, but with the following modifications. Following the cleavage step the thiazolinone is extracted, but rather than being converted to the PTH derivative it is discarded. Instead, a small fraction (5%) of the remaining peptide is taken and the newly liberated N-terminal amino acid determined in this sample by the dansyl method (see\n              \n                Chapter 35\n                \n              )."}

Here, we developed and verified a 3D finite-element framework to accurately model the tissue displacement under a multi-frequency HSWE setting. The HSWE results were compared using both simulation and phantom experiments against those from the Pulsed Shear Wave Elastography (PSWE) method which is widely used in shear wave elastography problems. Particularly, we analyzed the group and frequency-dependent phase velocities, focusing on the frequency range of 300 to 800 Hz. Additionally, we conducted parametric studies to examine the effects of inclusion size, stiffness, and viscosity. The HSWE framework provided accurate measurements of group and phase velocities, comparable to those obtained using the PSWE method. The median differences between HSWE and PSWE results were 5.21 % and 9.14 % for group and phase velocities, respectively, in simulations, and 13.98 % and 22.32 % for group and phase velocities, respectively, in phantom experiments. Parametric studies showed that the HSWE framework is effective in accurately characterizing the location, size, stiffness and viscoelastic properties of tissue inclusions, with notable improvements over PSWE, particularly for smaller inclusions at lower frequencies. Future work will focus on optimizing the HSWE framework for clinical use and developing inverse models to estimate the underlying viscoelastic shear moduli of the tissue to enhance its diagnostic capabilities."}

A large majority of clinical chemotherapeutic agents cannot achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Chelerythrine (CHE), a natural component with multitudinous pharmacological functions, has been proven to have outstanding antitumor effects in addition to antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and hypotensive effects. However, the anti-GBM effect of CHE has not been reported to date. The purpose of this paper is to observe the anti-GBM effect of CHE and further explore the related mechanism. GBM cell lines (U251 and T98G) and BALB/c nude mice were used in the experiments. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and clone formation assays were applied to detect the viability, proliferation and stemness of GBM cells. Flow cytometry was utilized to identify the effect of CHE on GBM apoptosis. Scratch and Transwell experiments reflected the migration and invasion of cells. In vivo, xenograft tumors were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice . The progression of tumors was assessed by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, western blot , bioinformatics, and immunohistochemistry experiments were used to explore the molecular mechanisms in depth. In vitro tests showed that CHE inhibited the proliferation, stemness, migration, and invasion of GBM cells and induced apoptosis. In vitro, CHE was observed to restrain the progression of xenograft tumors. We eventually proved that the cytotoxicity of CHE was relevant to the TGFB1-ERK1/2/Smad2/3-Snail/ZEB1 signaling pathway . CHE inhibited GBM progression by inhibiting the TGFB1-ERK1/2/Smad2/3-Snail/ZEB1 signaling pathway and is a potential chemotherapeutic drug for GBM."}

It analyzes the impact of the Agency's growing powers on the human rights of migrants. As shown by the 2020 New Pact on Migration and Asylum, the Agency enjoys strong political support for its integrated management of the external borders of the EU Member States. In particular, Frontex can carry out joint maritime, land and air operations and forced removals, in addition to deploying agents in third countries. In 2021, a permanent contingent of the European Border and Coast Guard with enforcement powers will be established. We argue that this unprecedented reinforcement of Frontexâs powers reflects the preference of the EU and its Member States to respond to migratory pressure primarily by securitizing their borders in order to deter unwanted migrants. This approach is not only counterproductive but also leads to serious violations of the rights of migrants, including asylum seekers. Despite some changes in the Agency's mandate to improve the rights' protection framework the lack of clear rules for the determination of Frontex's responsibility in joint operations and the absence of an effective remedy for rights violations remain particularly problematic."}

Materials and methods: After obtaining ethical clearance, the study was conducted among 78 permanent workers of a foundry in Coimbatore.&nbsp; First the demographic details of the subjects and their level of usage of PPE were recorded, in the pre-test. Then a comprehensive three faceted interventional program, consisting of strategies such as health education to the workers, peer motivation by co-workers, and posters in the working environment, was implemented simultaneously among all subjects. After three months of implementation of the program, the post-test was conducted and the data were analyzed to measure the effectiveness of the intervention.&nbsp; Results: After the interventional program, the workers showed significant improvement in PPE usage (p&lt;0.001) from the ‘pre-test’ level. Regarding their perception about which of the three strategies relatively contributed to bring out the improvement, most of the workers rated the strategy of peer motivation as ‘high’ effectiveness, health education- ‘average’ effectiveness and posters in working environment- ‘low’ effectiveness. Conclusion: Interventional program using multiple strategies in an integrated manner has synergistically enhanced the behaviour change among the workers."}

For a given start vertex s, a temporal exploration is a temporal walk that starts at s, traverses at most one edge in each layer, and visits all vertices of the temporal graph. We show that always-connected, k-edge-deficient temporal graphs with sufficient lifetime can always be explored in \n                \n                  \n                \n                $$O(kn \\log n)$$\n                \n               time steps.

It is a partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage of the right lung into the inferior vena cava. Up to 25% of cases are associated with other heart diseases. The incidence in adults is reported to be 0.5-0.7%; classically, the adult form does not have pulmonary arterial hypertension, and may be unnoticed and asymptomatic for many years. It often presents after the second decade of life with nonspecific symptoms. Without surgical repair, clinical worsening, increased pulmonary pressure and sustained pulmonary arterial hypertension ultimately occur, when the syndrome is associated with other congenital heart diseases. We present the case of a 38-year-old woman diagnosed with scimitar syndrome associated with a large superior sinus venosus atrial septal defect, who underwent successful surgical repair using a lateral pericardial tunnel technique to redirect right pulmonary venous flow to the left atrium through a left atriotomy. This repair has shown good medium-term results. Possible complications such as tunnel thrombosis and stenosis will need to be explored in future assessments, and follow up must be lifelong."}

Current studies on adversarial robustness in HGNNs face two key challenges: attacks often fall into local optima and poor transferability. These problems lead to inefficient attacks and also make it difficult to adapt to various attack scenarios. We propose the Future Momentum Gradient-based Attack on HGNNs, Called FMGHA. Specifically, FMGHA consists of two modules: (1) future gradient and (2) momentum gradient. FMGHA breaks through the local optimum restriction through the dynamic fusion of future and historical momentum gradient. Unlike traditional graph models with a singular training process, HGNNs may be subject to attacks at multiple stages of training. Therefore, we extend the structural attack (FMGHA-S) and hybrid attack (FMGHA-Mix) to realize full-stage attack adaptation for HGNNs. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed theoretical derivation for FMGHA, demonstrating that by guiding perturbations toward the global optimum region through future gradients, it avoids local optimum traps. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark hypergraph datasets. The results show that our proposed methods reduce the classification accuracy by about 5% on average, which outperform current state-of-the-art comparison models."}

The process of preparation of geometric and grid models is described, the boundary conditions used to set up the project in Ansys CFX Pre are given. A method for determining the cooling efficiency factor using Ansys CFX Post is also presented. The distributions of the temperature field and the coefficient of cooling efficiency over the surfaces of the blade to be cooled are obtained. Integral values of the coefficient of cooling efficiency for the designed blade at various cooling air flow rates were compared with statistical data. On the basis of the comparison a conclusion was made that the working blade considered in the work corresponds to the modern level of cooling efficiency."}

Owing to the important role of TNF-α in RA, the TNF-α-producing cells and the dynamics of its expression, the direct and indirect action of this cytokine and possible biological therapy for RA are described."}

Phylogenetic analysis showed that baculovirus gp37 genes and entomopoxvirus fusolin genes form two distinct and well-separated clades. There was no evidence of recent gene transfer between the two groups. The gp37 genes also showed a distant similarity to bacterial cellulose- and chitin-binding protein genes, but the significance of this is unclear. MbMNPV and LdMNPV gp37 were both transcribed from consensus baculovirus late transcription start sites. MbMNPV gp37 was additionally transcribed from a putative early transcription start site. Tunicamycin treatment of MbMNPV-infected cells confirmed that MbMNPV GP37 is N-glycosylated. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the protein is located exclusively in the cytoplasm, probably in the endoplasmic reticulum."}

De los 305 artículos publicados durante el año 2001, se encontró que la mayoría (45,2%) provenían de los Estados Unidos de América, principalmente en el área de la fisiología aplicada al deporte o al ejercicio (65,9%). Las técnicas de análisis estadístico más usadas fueron las de tipo paramétrico (72%): análisis de varianza en sus diversos modelos (57,7%), t student (34,8%), correlación (29,5%) y análisis de regresión (21%). Las técnicas de análisis no paramétrico (12,8%) más utilizadas fueron: chi cuadrado (7,9%) y Wilcoxon (4,9%). En el 12,8% de los estudios se reportaba el uso combinado de técnicas paramétricas y no paramétricas. También se realizaron pruebas de seguimiento (post hoc), y otras para analizar supuestos teóricos en los que se basan las pruebas paramétricas. El 61,6% de los investigadores no reportaron haber usado un paquete estadístico para analizar sus datos; mientras que aquellos que sí lo hicieron (38,4%), reportaron haber usado el programa Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (13,4%). En resumen, se observó que la mayoría de los estudios publicados en una revista científica de alto índice de impacto, que a su vez refleja la calidad de los manuscritos, fueron elaborados tomando en consideración un apropiado diseño y el uso adecuado de técnicas estadísticas avanzadas. Se sugiere a los educadores físicos, científicos del movimiento humano, readecuar los cursos de metodología de la investigación y análisis estadísticos para que incluyan las técnicas descritas en este documento.

Single-center, retrospective analysis of Norwood patients during their first extubation post-surgery from January 2015 to July 2021. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation within 48 h of extubation. Demographics, clinical characteristics, ventilatory settings, echo findings (right ventricular function, tricuspid regurgitation), and cumulative dose of sedation medications before extubation were compared between patients with successful or failed extubation. The analysis included 130 patients who underwent the Norwood procedure with 121 (93%) successful and 9 (7%) failed extubations. Univariate analyses showed that vocal cord anomaly (p = 0.05), lower end-tidal CO2 (p < 0.01), lower pulse-to-respiratory quotient (p = 0.02), and ketamine administration (p = 0.04) were associated with extubation failure. The use of opioids, benzodiazepines, dexmedetomidine, and ketamine are mutually correlated in this cohort. On multivariable analysis, the vocal cord anomaly (OR = 7.31, 95% CI 1.25–42.78, p = 0.027), pre-extubation end-tidal CO2 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.65–0.97, p = 0.025), and higher cumulative dose of opioids (OR = 10.16, 95% CI 1.25–82.43, p = 0.030) were independently associated with extubation failure while also controlling for post-extubation respiratory support (CPAP/BiPAP/HFNC vs NC), intubation length, and echo results. Higher cumulative opioid doses were associated with a greater incidence of extubation failure in infants post-Norwood procedure. Therefore, patients with higher cumulative doses of opioids should be more closely evaluated for extubation readiness in this population. Low end-tidal CO2 and low pulse-to-respiratory quotient were also associated with failed extubation. Consideration of the pulse-to-respiratory quotient in the extubation readiness assessment can be beneficial in the Norwood population."}

In accelerated life testing the measurements of life times are recorded under various conditions which are more severe than usual environment. The techniques related to the inference of life times in ALT are usually based on precise measurements. In practical applications life time data have two types of uncertainty, one is stochastic variation and the other is fuzziness. Classical stochastic models are developed to draw inference based on the variation among observations, and do nothing with fuzziness. By doing so the analyses are based on incomplete information and can lead to misleading conclusions. In this study estimators are proposed to cover fuzziness in addition to stochastic variation of the life times. The results based on the proposed methods are more suitable for realistic life time data."}

Using a nationwide quality registry, we retrieved data on patients treated in Finnish intensive care units (ICUs) during the period May 2012‒April 2013. Of 16,389 patients, 1827 (11.1%) were very old (aged 80 years or older). We defined a person with good functional status as someone independent in activities of daily living (ADL) and able to climb stairs without assistance; a person with poor functional status was defined as needing assistance for ADL or being unable to climb stairs. We adjusted for severity of illness and calculated the impact of PFS. Overall, hospital mortality was 21.3% and 1-year mortality was 38.2%. For emergency patients (73.5% of all), hospital mortality was 28% and 1-year mortality was 48%. The functional status at 1 year was comparable to the PFS in 78% of the survivors. PFS was poor for 43.3% of the patients. A poor PFS predicted an increased risk of in-hospital death, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 1.07–2.10), and of 1-year mortality, OR 2.18 (1.67–2.85). PFS data significantly improved the prediction of 1-year mortality. Of very old ICU patients, 62% were alive 1 year after ICU admission and 78% of the survivors had a functional status comparable to the premorbid situation. A poor PFS doubled the odds of death within a year. Knowledge of PFS improved the prediction of 1-year mortality."}

This paper proposes a structure-aware independently trained multi-scale registration network (SIMReg) to address this challenge. Using image pairs of different resolutions, independently train each registration network to extract image features of large deformation image pairs at different resolutions. In the testing stage, the large deformation registration is decomposed into a multi-scale registration process, and the deformation fields of different resolutions are fused by a step-by-step deformation method, thus solving the difficulty of directly processing large deformation. Meanwhile, the targeted introduction of MIND (modality independent neighborhood descriptor) structural features to guide network training enhances the registration of cardiac structural contours and improves the registration effect of local details. Experiments were carried out on the open cardiac dataset ACDC (automated cardiac diagnosis challenge), and the average Dice value of the experimental results of the proposed method was 0.833. Comparative experiments showed that the proposed SIMReg could better solve the problem of heart image registration and achieve a better registration effect on cardiac images. \n                \n                  \n                \n              "}

Scattering from molecules on etched cylinders, but not spheres, is sufficiently strong to allow spectra to be collected from single particles illuminated at 632.8 nm. SERS intensities from clusters of cylinders are found to scale linearly with particle number, whereas, for nanospheres, the scaling is non-linear. The linear scaling of SERS from cylinders is a reflection of the high enhancement provided by the sharp features of the individual particles; whereas, the non-linear scaling of SERS from clusters of spheres is found to be consistent with the near-field enhancement from inter-particle coupling simulated for clusters of spheres arranged in representative-observed geometries."}

Yuzu seed extract promotes skin turnover and may have a softening effect for the skin, and thus can be used as an additive for skin care products. Melanin is produced from tyrosine by multiple enzymes contained in melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. Because tyrosinase is the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin production, inhibition of this enzyme has been considered as a basic strategy for developing skin care products with a whitening effect."}

Angiomotin was recently identified as a new pro-angiogenic molecule. Angiomotin is expressed as two protein isoforms, p80 and p130. Whereas p80 stimulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, p130 is rather characteristic of stabilized and matured vessels. To date, how angiomotin expression is physiologically regulated in vivo remains largely unknown. We thus investigated (1) whether angiomotin was physiologically expressed in skeletal muscle; (2) whether exercise training, known to stimulate muscle angiogenesis, affected angiomotin expression; and (3) whether such regulation was altered in obesity, a pathological situation often associated with an impaired angiogenic activity and some capillary rarefaction in skeletal muscle. Two models of obesity were used: a high fat diet regime and Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF). Our results provide evidence that angiomotin was expressed both in capillaries and myofibres. In non-obese rats, the p80 isoform was increased in plantaris muscle in response to endurance training whereas p130 was unaffected. In obese animals, no change was observed for p80 whereas training significantly decreased p130 expression. Exercise training induced angiogenesis in plantaris from both obese and non-obese rats, possibly through the modulation of angiomotin level and its consequences on RhoA–ROCK signalling. In conclusion, any increase in p80 or decrease in p130, as respectively observed in non-obese and obese animals, led to an increased ratio between p80 and p130 isoforms. This increased angiomotin p80/p130 ratio might then directly reflect the enhanced angiogenic ability of skeletal muscle in response to exercise training."}

The enhancement mechanism of SAWs is investigated, followed by the proposal of a bio-microfluidic chip that integrates high-frequency SAWs. This chip includes a three-electrode sensor for electrochemical measurement, two interdigital transducers (IDTs) for the generation of SAWs, and a microchannel for real-time liquid transmission. The SAWs generated by two asymmetrically placed IDTs attenuates gradient in the liquid, leading to a rotational acoustic streaming (AS) near the electrochemical sensor. The rotational AS effectively improves the diffusion rate of the molecules to be measured by 41.24 % and shortens the response time to ∼ 5 s. The vibration from the SAWs improves the electron transfer rate of the working electrode surface of the sensor, thus, enhancing the sensitivity by ∼ 17 times to glucose. These results indicate that the integrated high-frequency SAWs are beneficial to achieving high-sensitive and quick-response POCT of low-concentration analytes. Moreover, the power of high-frequency SAWs is indeed small, therefore, making little damage to biomolecules , e.g., enzymes, which holds great significance for biosensors . • High-frequency SAWs enable high-sensitive and quick-response electrochemical POCT. • Enhancement mechanism of SAWs is studied by fluidics and electrochemical sensing. • SAWs accelerate molecule diffusion rate by 41.24 %, shortening response time to ∼ 5 s. • SAWs reduce charge transfer resistance by 61.16 %, improving sensitivity of 17-fold. • High-frequency SAWs are biomolecule-friendly, benefiting for biosensors."}

Our hybrid approach uses Frobenius’ method and Moebius transformations in the vicinity of each of the singular points of the hypergeometric equation, which leads to a natural decomposition of the real axis into domains. In each domain, solutions to the hypergeometric equation are constructed via the well-conditioned ultraspherical spectral method. The solutions are matched at the domain boundaries to lead to a solution which is analytic on the whole compactified real line $\\mathbb {R}\\cup {\\infty }$, except for the singular points and cuts of the Riemann surface on which the solution is defined. The solution is further extended to the whole Riemann sphere by using the same approach for ellipses enclosing the singularities. The hypergeometric equation is solved on the ellipses with the boundary data from the real axis. This solution is continued as a harmonic function to the interior of the disk by solving the Laplace equation in polar coordinates with an optimal complexity Fourier–ultraspherical spectral method. In cases where logarithms appear in the solution, a hybrid approach involving an analytical treatment of the logarithmic terms is applied. We show for several examples that machine precision can be reached for a wide class of parameters, but also discuss almost degenerate cases where this is not possible."}

The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that (1) reduced levels of spontaneous physical activity in old rats are associated with skeletal muscle vascular remodelling (e.g. arterial rarefaction), and (2) consequent to a vascular remodelling, calculated shear stress is maintained in feed arteries of aged muscle at levels commensurate with that in young. Activity during daily light and dark cycles (12–12 h) was measured at 30-s intervals for 2 weeks in young (6 months; n= 9) and old (24 months; n= 9) Fisher 344 rats via telemetry. Subsequently, the gastrocnemius complex and soleus muscles were excised and all feed arteries were counted, isolated, cannulated and maximally dilated for measurement of luminal diameter. Resting blood flow was also measured to estimate vessel wall shear-stress in the feed arteries perforating the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. Overall, young rats were ∼1.6 times more active during dark periods and ∼4 times more active during light periods than old rats. In addition, young rats had approximately one additional feed artery perforating both the soleus (young, 3.3 ± 0.2; old, 2.6 ± 0.2 vessels; P < 0.05) and gastrocnemius (young, 8.8 ± 0.1; old, 7.5 ± 0.2 vessels, P < 0.05) muscles compared with old rats. However, average vessel wall shear stress at rest was similar between young and old rats (soleus: Y, 65 ± 5; O, 64 ± 5 dynes cm−2; gastrocnemius: Y, 329 ± 22; O, 327 ± 27 dynes cm−2) resulting from a larger vessel diameter in arteries from old rats. In conclusion, lower activity levels of old rats likely contribute to resistance artery rarefaction and, consequently, this provides a plausible mechanism for the altered blood flow patterns observed during exercise in aged skeletal muscle."}

One of the primary reasons for this is the shift in distribution of occupancy patterns, with many people working or learning from home. This has created a need for new forecasting methods that can adapt to changing occupancy patterns. Online learning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, as it enables building managers to adapt to changes in occupancy patterns and adjust energy usage accordingly. With online learning, models can be updated incrementally with each new data point, allowing them to learn and adapt in real-time. Continual learning methods offer a powerful solution to address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in online learning, allowing energy forecasting models to retain valuable insights while accommodating new data and improving generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios. Another solution is to use human mobility data as a proxy for occupancy, leveraging the prevalence of mobile devices to track movement patterns and infer occupancy levels. Human mobility data can be useful in this context as it provides a way to monitor occupancy patterns without relying on traditional sensors or manual data collection methods. We have conducted extensive experiments using data from four buildings to test the efficacy of these approaches. However, deploying these methods in the real world presents several challenges."}

Although it is generally treated as a part of the cockling and curling due to moisture, consistency of paste, and defects from the mounting procedures, we demonstrate that the spontaneous extrinsic curvature incurred from the storage is in fact more essential to understanding and curing Qi-Wa. In contrast to the former factors whose effects are less predictable, the plastic deformation and strain distribution on a membrane are a well-defined mechanical problem. We study this phenomenon by experiments, theoretical models, and molecular dynamics simulation, and obtain consistent scaling relations for the Qi-Wa height. This knowledge enables us to propose modifications on the traditional mounting techniques that are tested on real mounted paper to be effective at mitigating Qi-Wa.

However, gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) are a significant production-limiting factor. Anthelmintics play a role in GIN management; however, few anthelmintic classes are available in many low-middle-income countries. Utilising a limited range of classes may increase selection for anthelmintic resistance; therefore, strategies to reduce other selective pressures are of heightened importance. Avoiding anthelmintic underdosing is one such strategy, but it can be challenging without access to accurate bodyweight measurement. Many previous studies have used thoracic girth as a practical proxy for bodyweight in goats; however, they have rarely considered the potential impact of natural variation on therapeutic doses. Here, the relationship between bodyweight and thoracic girth was modelled using data from 820 goats from three Malawian biomes in two seasons, with the specific aim of avoiding underestimation of bodyweight. The internally cross-validated linear regression (∛Weight ~ 0.053 + 0.040*Girth, R2 = 0.92, rounded up to the nearest 5 kg) was validated against data from an additional 352 Malawian goats (1.4% of goats allocated an underdose and 10.2% allocated a dose > 200% of bodyweight). The equation was further externally validated using an historical dataset of 150 goats from Assam, India (2.7% of goats were allocated to an underdose and 24.8% allocated to a > 200% of bodyweight). These results suggest that a more globally generalisable approach may be feasible, provided the accuracy of the estimate is considered alongside the therapeutic index of the pharmaceutical."}

A correct comprehension of voluntary movements is one of the most complicated problems in biology and medicine. In adult men, voluntary movements are not merely directed by images of vitally important objects of the environment but also produced as the result of definite conscious aims planned to satisfy personal or social needs. This is accomplished by means of the verbal planning of work activities. The functional system that reproduces images of the external world consists of sensory and nonsensory stellate and internuncial pyramidal neurons connected with cortical projection neurons, which serve as the starting mechanism of orientating movements of the eyes and the head. The involuntary nature of the automatized behavior becomes apparent when a food box is moved in the sight of a dog. In response to the food signal, the dog runs to the place where the food box usually is, sniffs there at the floor, and only then goes to the new place where the food box is placed. When the conditioned chain reflex cannot be carried out because the environmental situation has been changed, the reproduction of the image of the food box turns the automatized involuntary behavior into a voluntary one."}

McHarg developed an ecological planning theory and method for analyzing biophysical and sociocultural landscape characteristics and for evaluating these to determine suitable land uses. McHarg’s classic 1969 text, Design with Nature brought ecological planning to a mass audience, and his suitability analysis method was widely adopted. The theory, however, was neglected, as McHarg himself noted in his preface to the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of the book. A half-century later, there remains a need for theories that address the fit between humans and their environments, especially given ongoing environmental concerns marked by complexity and uncertainty. A fresh look at McHarg’s ambitious theory reveals it to have considerable depth, with much of its scientific foundation retaining relevance. It is unique in its capacity for connecting planning and design to ecology and evolutionary biology. In particular, energy, order, and disorder; adaptation; health; creativity; and human agency were addressed by McHarg, and these concepts remain integral to environmental problem-solving today. Using McHarg’s writings as the basis for a detailed analysis, we explore the meaning and significance of McHarg’s parallel constructs: syntropic fitness–health and entropic misfitting–morbidity and death. The theory is placed in the historical and contemporary contexts of environmental planning and the science of ecology. Criticisms of McHarg’s theory are addressed, and outdated aspects are identified. We connect relevant parts of the theory to socio-ecological practice through clear explanation of abstract concepts and identification of themes important for resilience planning and adaptive design.\n"}

Symbiosis with Frankia allows the Alnus species to fix nitrogen (N) at the rate of several to 320 kg N ha−1 year−1 with a nodule biomass of 16–480 kg ha−1. Alnus species ensures an effective supply of N to soils because of the high N content of leaf litter, rapid decomposition rate, and the influx of herbivorous insects. In addition, the association between regenerated endozoochorous species and Alnus hirsuta suggests that N2 fixation in Alnus species influences the distribution patterns of regenerated plants as well as improve soil fertility. N2 fixation by the Alnus–Frankia symbiotic relationship may be positively associated with elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Nodule biomass increased under elevated CO2 due to enhanced plant growth, rather than changes in biomass allocation. The inhibitory effect of high soil N on nodulation was retained under elevated CO2, and the effects of elevated CO2 on N2 fixation depended on soil P availability, drought, and many other abiotic and biotic factors. Recent free-air CO2 enrichment experiments have demonstrated increased N2 fixation in A. \n                           glutinosa exposed to elevated CO2 in mixed-species stands containing non-N2-fixers but not in monocultures, suggesting that N2 fixation depends on an association with non-N2-fixing tree species.

Recent reports using noninvasive retinal amyloid imaging, optical coherence tomography angiography, and histological examinations support the existence of vascular-structural abnormalities and vascular amyloid β-protein (Aβ) deposits in retinas of AD patients. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such retinal vascular pathology were not previously explored. Here, by modifying a method of enzymatically clearing non-vascular retinal tissue and fluorescent immunolabeling of the isolated blood vessel network, we identified substantial pericyte loss together with significant Aβ deposition in retinal microvasculature and pericytes in AD. Evaluation of postmortem retinas from a cohort of 56 human donors revealed an early and progressive decrease in vascular PDGFRβ in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to cognitively normal controls. Retinal PDGFRβ loss significantly associated with increased retinal vascular Aβ40 and Aβ42 burden. Decreased vascular LRP-1 and early apoptosis of pericytes in AD retina were also detected. Mapping of PDGFRβ and Aβ40 levels in pre-defined retinal subregions indicated that certain geometrical and cellular layers are more susceptible to AD pathology. Further, correlations were identified between retinal vascular abnormalities and cerebral Aβ burden, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and clinical status. Overall, the identification of pericyte and PDGFRβ loss accompanying increased vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer’s retina implies compromised blood–retinal barrier integrity and provides new targets for AD diagnosis and therapy."}

The central four-vertex function $Q$ generated by these averages is topologically analyzed in standard fashion in terms of an irreducible four-vertex quantity $e$.

It is furthermore pointed out that the existence of a logarithmic specific-heat anomaly puts an additional constraint on quadruplet averages (which is verified in an Appendix by direct calculation on the Ising-Onsager two-dimensional square lattice). Upon making a simplifying functional assumption for $Q$, this latter quantity may be entirely determined above ${T}_{c}$ by one of the necessary conditions. This leads at ${T}_{c}$ to a ${k}^{\\frac{d}{2}}$ spectrum ($d=\\mathrm{dimensionality}$) and above ${T}_{c}$ to a logarithmic specific heat, both of which were adduced by Abe's Ising-model version of the ${\\mathrm{He}}^{4}$ speculative analysis due to Patashinskii and Pokrovskii (but for different reasons from those in the present analysis). Sinec the Abe-Patashinskii-Pokrovskii spectrum almost certainly exhibits an incorrect exponent, an alternative and more powerful functional assumption for $Q$ is suggested which still yields a soluble theory in principle, but construction of the solution is not attempted here."}

In order to improve the prediction accuracy, the parametric tuning of models has been carried out with the two met heuristic algorithms: Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and also validated with the novel application of Evolve Class Topper Optimization (ECTO) method. Corresponding performance measures, including Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Max Error (ME), and Coefficient of Determination (R2), are employed to evaluate each model's performance. The results obtained through a comparative assessment of all machine learning models confirmed that the ECTO based models have outperformed others and the RFR-ECTO model is the best forecasting model having the highest R2 scores of 0.9441, 0.9107 and 0.8882 and the lowest RMSE value of 75.8613 W/m2, 40.8714 W/m2, 94.8916 W/m2 for GHI, DHI and DNI respectively which ensures that the designed predictive model can be implemented for prediction of solar energy."}

Zn–Zr particles with different morphologies form during solution treatment due to the additions of Zn. As the Zn content increases, the number density of Zn–Zr particles also increases. Microstructural comparisons of peak-aged studied alloys indicate that varying Zn additions could profoundly influence the competitive precipitation behavior. In the peak-aged Zn-free alloy, β′′ phases are the key strengthening precipitates. When 0.5 wt% Zn is added, besides β′′ precipitates, additional fine β1 precipitates form. With the addition of 0.8 wt% Zn, the peak-aged 0.8Zn alloy is characterized by predominantly prismatic β1 and scanty basal precipitate distributions. The enhanced precipitation of β1 should be primarily attributable to the presence of increased Zn–Zr dispersoids. When Zn content further increases to 1 wt%, the precipitation of basal precipitates is markedly enhanced. Basal precipitates and β1 phases are the key strengthening precipitates in the peak-aged 1Zn alloy.

Additionally, ERP analyses revealed that (1) convergent gazes evoked both left and right hemisphere N170, while non-convergent gazes evoked N170 mainly in the hemisphere contralateral to the cueing face; (2) effects of target congruency on target-locked N1 and P3 were modulated by gaze convergence. These findings shed light on temporal features of the processing of multi-gaze cues."}

Miller et al. now report that endogenous presentation drives most CD4+ T cell responses in influenza-infected mice. By convention, CD4+ T lymphocytes recognize foreign and self peptides derived from internalized antigens in combination with major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. Alternative pathways of epitope production have been identified, but their contributions to host defense have not been established. We show here in a mouse infection model that the CD4+ T cell response to influenza, critical for durable protection from the virus, is driven principally by unconventional processing of antigen synthesized within the infected antigen-presenting cell, not by classical processing of endocytosed virions or material from infected cells. Investigation of the cellular components involved, including the H2-M molecular chaperone, the proteasome and γ-interferon–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase revealed considerable heterogeneity in the generation of individual epitopes, an arrangement that ensures peptide diversity and broad CD4+ T cell engagement. These results could fundamentally revise strategies for rational vaccine design and may lead to key insights into the induction of autoimmune and anti-tumor responses."}

The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of contrast-enhanced spectral mammography in the assessment of suspicious microcalcification and in predicting the grade of DCIS. Three hundred and forty cases with suspicious microcalcification were reviewed in this study. We excluded 160 cases associated with masses. We enrolled 180 cases for analysis of suspicious microcalcification on mammograms with no underlying masses. We reviewed the microcalcification for their morphology, distribution, and associated pathological enhancement according to BI-RADS lexicon with pathology results reviewed and classified into benign and malignant which subdivided into low, intermediate, or high-grade DCIS or invasive carcinoma. Three hundred and forty cases with suspicious microcalcification were reviewed in this study. We excluded 160 cases associated with masses. Forty-five of 180 cases were benign, and 135/180 cases were malignant. Twenty-five of 135 cases were diagnosed as invasive breast carcinomas while 110/135 were ductal carcinoma in situ. From the latter, 110 patients with DCIS, 22/110 cases were low grade, 11/110 cases were intermediate grade, and 77/110 cases were high grade (44 with micro-invasion). A total of 25 invasive carcinomas showed pathological non-mass enhancement, 76/77 cases of high-grade DCIS, and 6/11 cases of intermediate-grade DCIS. No abnormal enhancement appeared with benign entities, low-grade DCIS, and 5/11 cases of intermediate DCIS. The diagnostic performance of CESM in anticipation of high grade in DCIS patients was sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 81.8%, and accuracy of 93.1%. CESM sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in prediction of invasiveness or high-grade DCIS were 98.5%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. CESM can provide a fundamental contribution in the evaluation of suspicious microcalcification as high-grade DCIS or invasive component can present by non-mass enhancement, but enhancement paucity is favorable to diagnose benign lesion or non-invasive/low-grade DCIS."}

In all cases, mortality was clearly dose, time and application method dependent. It has been seen that higher concentrations were found to be more effective than lower concentrations. Moreover, significant level of mortality was found at 3DAT but reached to the peak level at 7DAT in case of all selected CSIs. Bioassay study has showed that all the selected CSIs became able to enter the insect body through contact as well as stomach action to disrupt moulting process by inhibiting chitin synthesis that confirmed the contact and systemic actions of the selected CSIs.

In contrast, the similar mouse protein Cyp2d-9 was first characterized as a testosterone 16α-hydroxylase. No common substrates have been reported for the two enzymes. Here we investigate the structural basis of this difference in substrate specificity. We have earlier used a combination of NMR data and homology modelling to generate a three-dimensional model of CYP2D6 [Modi, Paine, Sutcliffe, Lian, Primrose, Wolf, C. R. and Roberts (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4541–4550]. We have now generated a homology model of Cyp2d-9 and compared the two models to identify specific amino acid residues that we believe form the substrate-binding site in each protein and therefore influence catalytic selectivity. Although there are many similarities in active site structure, the most notable difference is a phenylalanine residue (Phe-483) in CYP2D6, which in the model is located such that the bulky phenyl ring is positioned across the channel mouth, thus limiting the size of substrate that can access the active site. In Cyp2d-9, the corresponding position is occupied by an isoleucine residue, which imposes fewer steric restraints on the size of substrate that can access the active site. To investigate whether the amino acid residue at this position does indeed influence the catalytic selectivity of these enzymes, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Phe-483 in CYP2D6 to isoleucine and also to tryptophan. CYP2D6, Cyp2d-9 and both mutant CYP2D6 proteins were co-expressed with NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase as a functional mono-oxygenase system in Escherichia coliand their relative catalytic activities towards bufuralol and testosterone were determined. All four proteins exhibited catalytic activity towards bufuralol but only Cyp2d-9 catalysed the formation of 16α-hydroxytesterone. Uniquely, the CYP2D6F483I mutant acquired the ability to metabolize testosterone to a novel product, which was identified by MS and proton NMR spectroscopy as 15α-hydroxytestosterone. NMR spin relaxation experiments were used to measure distances between the haem iron and protons of testosterone bound to the CYP2D6F483I mutant. These experiments demonstrate that very minor modifications to the active site structure of CYP2D6 can have a profound influence on the substrate specificity of the enzyme."}

In patients with symptomatic meniscal tears, the location and tear pattern play a vital role in clinical management. Tears in the central white-white zone are less amenable to repair due to poor vascularity. Patients may be indicated for APM or non-surgical intervention depending on the tear pattern and symptoms. Non-surgical management for meniscal pathology includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy (PT), and intraarticular injections to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. There have been several landmark multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the outcomes of APM compared to PT or sham surgery in symptomatic degenerative meniscal tears. These most notably include the 2013 Meniscal Tear in Osteoarthritis Research (MeTeOR) Trial, the 2018 ESCAPE trial, and the sham surgery-controlled Finnish Degenerative Meniscal Lesion Study (FIDELITY), which failed to identify substantial benefits of APM over nonoperative treatment or even placebo surgery. Despite an abundance of literature exploring outcomes of APM for degenerative meniscus tears, there is little consensus among surgeons about the drivers of good outcomes following APM. It is often difficult to determine if the presenting symptoms are secondary to the meniscus pathology or the degenerative disease in patients with concomitant OA. A central tenet of managing meniscal pathology is to preserve tissue whenever possible. Most RCTs show that exercise therapy may be non-inferior to APM in degenerative tears if repair is not possible. Given this evidence, patients who fail nonoperative treatment should be counseled regarding the risks of APM before proceeding to surgical management."}

Plant-derived sugars and lipids are key nutritional sources for plant associated fungi. However, the relationship between utilization of host-derived sugars and lipids during development of the symbiotic association remains unknown. Here we show that the fungus Metarhizium robertsii also needs plant-derived lipids to develop symbiotic relationship with plants. The fatty acid binding proteins FABP1 and FABP2 are important for utilization of plant-derived lipids as the deletion of Fabp1 and Fabp2 significantly reduced the ability of M. robertsii to colonize rhizoplane and rhizosphere of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana . Deleting Fabp1 and Fabp2 increased sugar utilization by upregulating six sugar transporters, and this explains why deleting the monosaccharide transporter gene Mst1 , which plays an important role in utilization of plant-derived sugars, had no impact on the ability of the double-gene deletion mutant ΔFabp1::ΔFabp2 to colonize plant roots. FABP1 and FABP2 were also found in other plant-associated Metarhizium species, and they were highly expressed in the medium using the tomato root exudate as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, suggesting that they could be also important for these species to develop symbiotic relationship with plants.

The aim of the current study was the budget impact analysis of using FDC for treatment of patients with storage symptoms associated with BPH, who do not respond to first-line tamsulosin monotherapy in Russia.\nWe considered three therapy scenarios: 1) FDC of solifenacin 6 mg + tamsulosin 0.4 mg modified-release tablets; 2) free combination of solifenacin (5 mg) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg modified release capsules, MRC); 3) free combination of solifenacin (5 mg) and tamsulosin (0.4 mg prolonged-release tablets, PRT). We employed 1-year Markov model of storage symptoms associated with BPH, as proposed in Nazir et al (2015). Drug, GP visits and prostate resection costs were considered.\n35,400 out of 250,000 men suffering from storage symptoms associated with BPH are eligible for government reimbursement. FDC drug was cost saving, as the annual cost was $384 per patient, which is $35 less than the free combination involving MRC and $195 less when using free combination involving PRT. The overall healthcare annual expenses of using the FDC drug was $96 million or $9 million less than free combination with MRC ($49 million less than free combination with PRT). Government reimbursement costs for FDC were $10 million or $1 million less when using free combination with MRC ($7 million less when using free combination with PRT).\nUsing the FDC drug for treatment of patients with storage symptoms associated with BPH is a cost-saving alternative to the free combination of solifenacin and tamsulosin."}

In this study, we assessed the safety, feasibility and efficacy of a multiple tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-pulsed DC vaccine in 5 patients with advanced HCC. DCs were generated by culturing blood monocytes in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 for 5 days. The DC vaccine was prepared by pulsing DCs with cytoplasmic transduction peptide-attached α-fetoprotein, glypican-3 and MAGE-1 recombinant fusion proteins and cultivating them in the presence of maturation cocktail. DCs were injected subcutaneously near the inguinal lymph nodes, followed by topical application of toll-like receptor-7 agonist around the injection site. We showed that our DC vaccine was safe and well-tolerated over 6 vaccinations in 5 patients. All 5 patients showed T cell responses against TAAs. Clinical benefit was observed in one of the 5 patients. In conclusion, the feasibility, safety and immune activity of DCs pulsed with TAAs were confirmed in HCC patients. However, clinical response was detected only in one patient. Future trials may consider applying this therapy in a less advanced stage to obtain better clinical responses."}

However, baseline factors influencing mid-term RV reverse remodeling after treatment and its prognostic capability remain unclear. We studied 54 PH patients. Mid-term RV remodeling was assessed in terms of the RV area, which was traced planimetrically at the end-systole (RVESA). RV reverse remodeling was defined as a relative decrease in the RVESA of at least 15% at 10.2 ± 9.4 months after treatment. Long-term follow-up was 5 years. Adverse events occurred in ten patients (19%) and mid-term RV reverse remodeling after treatment was observed in 37 (69%). Patients with mid-term RV reverse remodeling had more favorable long-term outcomes than those without (log-rank: p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that RV relative wall thickness (RV-RWT), as calculated as RV free-wall thickness/RV basal linear dimension at end-diastole, was an independent predictor of mid-term RV reverse remodeling (OR 1.334; 95% CI, 1.039–1.713; p = 0.03). Moreover, patients with RV-RWT ≥0.21 showed better long-term outcomes than did those without (log-rank p = 0.03), while those with RV-RWT ≥0.21 and mid-term RV reverse remodeling had the best long-term outcomes. Patients with RV-RWT <0.21 and without mid-term RV reverse remodeling, on the other hand, had worse long-term outcomes than other sub-groups. In conclusions, RV-RWT could predict mid-term RV reverse remodeling after treatment in PH patients, and was associated with long-term outcomes. Our finding may have clinical implications for better management of PH patients."}

Eine Analyse epidemiologischer Studien ergab eine logarithmische Regression zwischen relativem kardialen Risiko (RR) und dem wöchentlichen Energieverbrauch E in kcal: RR = 1,23 – 0,06 ln E (kcal) (r = 0,58, p < 0,0001). Die Beziehung zwischen RR und der körperlichen Leistungsfähigkeit („physical fitness“) zeigt einen S-förmigen Verlauf mit einem Schwellenwert und Plateau. Eine relative Risikoreduktion von 20 – 25 % ist sowohl durch einen Mehrverbrauch von 1000 – 1500 Kilokalorienals auch durch eine Steigerung der Leistungsfähigkeitzu erreichen. An Hand physikalischer und physiologischer Grundlagen werden die mechanisch und metabolisch erbrachte Leistung P (Power) der arbeitenden Muskulatur Pmech = 0,01433 Belastung (W) bzw. Pmet = 0,06 Belastung (W) sowie der Wirkungsgrad n = Pmech/Pmet = 0,24 berechnet. Der Energieverbrauch E, z. B. bei Ergometertraining, errechnet sich aus der Belastung in Watt (W) im Zeitabschnitt t (min) nach: E (kcal) = 0,06 Belastung (W) t (min). Wird der Energieverbrauch in metabolischen Äquivalenten METs (1 MET = 3,5 ml 02/min/kg) angegeben, kann unter Berücksichtigung des Körpergewichtes (kg) umgerechnet werden: Belastung P (W) = 0,28 (METs – 1) Körpergewicht (kg) bzw. METs = 1 + Belastung P (W)/0,28 Körpergewicht (kg). Der Energieverbrauch E in kcal beträgt wiederum: E (kcal) = 0,02 (METs – 1) t (min) Körpergewicht (kg). Unter Anwendung dieser Beziehungen und entsprechender Tabellenwerke kann der Energieverbrauch bei einem “moderaten” aeroben Trainingsprogramm berechnet werden; z. B. ergeben bei einem Körpergewicht von 80 kg tägliches Ergometertraining mit 75 W, zügiges Gehen mit 6 km/h oder Radfahren mit 15 km/h über jeweils 30 Minuten einen wöchentlichen Mehrverbrauch von ca. 1075 kcal. Bei der Verordnung der Trainingsintensität zur Steigerung der Leistungsfähigkeit wird ein dynamisches Ausdauertraining unterhalb der individuellen anaeroben Schwelle (IANS) also optimal und sicher angesehen, um eine ausgeprägte sympathiko- adrenerge Aktivierung mit ischämie-triggernden, vasokonstriktorischen und arrhythmogenen Effekten zu vermeiden. Es bestehen zahlreiche Empfehlungen, die sich auf die im Belastungstest erreichte maximale Herzfrequenz, die Leistungsfähigkeit, Sauerstoffaufnahme, Herzfrequenzreserve\noder den subjektiven Anstrengungsgrad beziehen. Wir fanden bei der Analyse der Lactat-Leistungskurven von\nPatienten mit koronarer Herzkrankheit und niedrig normaler Ejektionsfraktion, dass die IANS im Mittel bei 71 % von Wmax und 80 % der IANS („safety margin“) bei 57 % von Wmax erreicht werden. Unter Berücksichtigung der Standardabweichung entspricht dies in unserem Kollektiv einem Trainingsbereich von 50 – 75 % von Wmax. Zwischen %Wmax bei 80 % der IANS und der absoluten Belastungskapazität Wmax besteht eine lineare Beziehung (r = 0,94; p < 0,005).

This allows us to show that the suppression of the gauge-field production due to the Schwinger effect can prevent the backreaction in scenarios in which it would otherwise be relevant. Moreover, we point out that the induced current, $\\mathbit{J}=\\ensuremath{\\sigma}\\mathbit{E}$, also dampens the Bunch--Davies vacuum fluctuations deep inside the Hubble horizon. We describe this suppression by a new parameter $\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\Delta}}$ that is related to the time integral over the conductivity $\\ensuremath{\\sigma}$ which hence renders the description of the entire system inherently nonlocal in time.

The aim of this work was to characterize novel Prunus rootstocks in regard to tolerance to water deficit as a key trait to cope the challenges for agriculture imposed by the climate change expected in the near future. Here, we report the assessment of physiological parameters and growth responses to water deficit of four interspecific Prunus rootstock hybrids. Two commercially available rootstocks, ROOTPAC®40 and ROOTPAC®20, and two experimental genotypes, AGAF 0301-07 and ADAGAF 0403 were evaluated. Plants were subjected  to two irrigation treatments (well-watered and water deficit) during 33 days. During this period, stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic CO2 assimilation (Pn) were measured. At the end of the experiment, biomass accumulation was registered for all the genotypes, while the expression of seven aquaporins belonging to plasma membrane intrinsic proteins subfamily (PIPs) was assessed in ROOTPAC®40 and ROOTPAC®20. ROOTPAC®20 had a decrease in the aquaporin gene expression in roots and this could be associated with its early decline in transpiration. Biomass accumulation was lower in ROOTPAC®20, AGAF 0301-07 and ADAGAF 0403 due to the water deficit. However, ROOTPAC®40 showed a larger whole-plant water use efficiency under water deficit because of a later reduction in relative transpiration under low fractions of transpirable soil water. This response resulted in higher biomass accumulation in ROOTPAC®40 than the other genotypes. We identified ROOTPAC®40 as a tolerant genotype to water deficit, which is majorly explained by a later reduction in relative transpiration under water deficit."}

Macrobenthos mean densities ranged from 104 to 13 808 ind m−2, with highest values off Concepción (∼36°S), where highest chloroplastic pigment equivalents were also measured. Polychaetes were the numerically dominant group in all transects and depths, followed by peracarid crustaceans. Species richness and diversity correlated with observed changes in bottom-water oxygen concentrations and sediment-bound pigments. Our results show that the shelf macrobenthic communities were negatively affected by low oxygen. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis evidenced depth-related station groups which may be related to the different environments provided by the water masses involved. Indeed, the depth ranges of stations groups with their specific species inventories coincide quite well with the boundaries of the three important water masses in the region, the Equatorial Subsurface Water (∼50 m to ∼400 m depth), the Antarctic Intermediate Water (∼400 to ∼1200 m depth), and the Pacific Deep Water (&gt;1200 m depth)."}

Metadichol , a new nanoemulsion formulation that acts as an inverse agonist of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), was tested for its immunomodulatory effects on VDBP release in differentiated human monocytic cell lines Methods: THP-1 and U937 monocytic cell lines were differentiated with PMA (20 ng/ml) and stimulated with LPS. Various Metadichol  concentrations (1 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml) were applied to cells for 48 hours. ELISA measured VDBP levels. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation significantly elevated VDBP release in both cell lines (10.19-fold in THP-1 cells: 117.01 ± 2.27 ng/ml; 12.03-fold in U937 cells: 222.56 ± 3.19 ng/ml vs. controls). Metadichol  therapy altered VDBP release in a dose-dependent manner. Metadichol , at 100 ng/ml, significantly increased VDBP release (7.12-fold increase in THP-1: 81.73 ± 2.37 ng/ml; 8.36-fold increase in U937: 154.68 ± 3.19 ng/ml) while reducing LPS-induced inflammation. Metadichol  shows dose-dependent immunomodulatory effects on VDBP release in human monocytic cells via VDR inverse agonism, outperforming traditional small molecule immunomodulators in immunological activation. The compound's VDR pathway modulation of VDBP levels without surpassing inflammatory thresholds suggests balanced immune response activation with potential therapeutic uses in immunological deficiency, cancer immunotherapy, and age-related immune decline."}

Network changes in the data plane are propagated to the control plane through an interface existing between a switch and its controller and also among the controllers. Majority of the relevant research work focuses on building a control layer that aims to minimize communication delay between a switch and its controller. Such a control layer may compromise on the data loss that occurs as a result of a link break in the network. We propose an algorithm that aims to cut down the data loss as a result of a link break, resulting in a control layer which is more failure resilient.

This study investigates student teachers' perceptions of computer technology in relation to their intention to use computers. The purpose is to shed light on more effective ways to motivate the use of computer technology in schools. Based on an expanded variation of the Technology Acceptance Model, 84 completed surveys of student teachers were collected at a local university in Sweden. Overall, the results indicated that (1) student teachers' perceived usefulness of computer technology had a direct significant effect on their intention to use it; (2) student teachers' perceived ease of use had only an indirect significant effect on intention to use; however, (3) student teachers' subjective norm, that is the possible influence of external expectations, did not have any direct or indirect significant effects on their intention to use computer technology. Theoretical and practical implications that follow from the results are discussed."}

Currently, the heating measures for rural households face significant disadvantages such as reliance on fossil fuels, poor thermal comfort, and high carbon emissions. This study designed a solar-coupled domestic biomass boiler parallel heating system (SBPHS) with collaborative optimization. The SBPHS was developed based on a typical rural residence in cold regions. Subsequently, a parametric analysis was performed on both component configuration and operating parameters. Furthermore, we determined optimal configurations of the SBPHS using the life cycle cost (LCC) as the optimization objective. Solar fraction, total power consumption, effective heat collection and boiler runtime were used as performance indicators to evaluate the system. Simulation results were in good agreement with measured data. Parametric analyses indicated that component design should consider energy performance and economics, especially in rural areas. As a start/stop signal for the collector system, the collector-tank temperature difference significantly affected effective heat collection and system energy consumption. Further, flow rates had significant impacts on all performance indicators, especially collector flow rate. Considering the optimum operating conditions throughout the system’s life cycle, Hooke-Jeeves algorithm was adopted to optimize component configurations and operating parameters simultaneously. Post-optimization, LCC of the SBPHS was reduced by 12.3 %. The optimized system could achieve a solar energy share of up to 62.7 %, total energy consumption reduction of 13.6 %, and biomass fuel consumption reduction of 26.3 %, indicating significant energy savings. These findings enhance the feasibility of implementing the SBPHS in rural residences in cold areas and provide theoretical foundation for the design and operation of system."}

This review aims at insight into the role of Over the Counter (OTC) products in acne treatment and maintenance in Latin America. Methods: A panel of dermatologists from Latin America employed an online procedure to answer questions on this topic: What is used, by whom, when, how, and why? Before the meeting, a survey was completed by dermatologists from Latin America on OTC products for acne recommended by the panel in their clinical practice. The survey information and a literature review on Latin American acne guidelines and clinical studies were used to address this topic. Results: The survey responders' choices on OTC products for monotherapy comprised alpha-hydroxy acid and beta-hydroxy acid-containing serum, ceramides-containing foaming cleanser, a soap-free exfoliating cleanser, adapalene, and benzoyl peroxide-containing products. The clinicians recommended OTC cleansing products mainly for younger patients at a starter level and for women with adult acne. The use of these OTC products is similar to practice described in therapeutic acne guidelines and algorithms for Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal, Europe, and the United States. Conclusions: Advisors agreed that OTC products and skincare recommendations, in addition to the use of prescription medications, are a crucial part of successful acne therapy. Participants noted that the use of quality OTC products could improve acne symptomatology and severity.

However, the physiological basis involved in the ripening process of guava is not totally clear, which makes it difficult to develop technologies to enhance fruit storability. Two experiments were carried out with the objective of determining the ripening behavior of 'Pedro Sato' guavas. In the first experiment, guava fruits at three maturity stages (I - dark green, II - light green and III - yellow-green) were stored at room temperature (23 ± 1°C and 85 ± 5 % RH). The respiratory rate, ethylene production, pulp and skin colours, and firmness were evaluated. In the second experiment, ethylene and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) were applied to guavas at the light green maturity stage and the ripening behaviour during storage at room temperature was studied. Fruits from all maturity stages showed a gradual increase in the respiratory rate and ethylene production. The intense changes in pulp and skin colours and in firmness preceded the maximum respiratory rate and ethylene production. 1-MCP reduced the rate of ripening, while the application of ethylene did not promote this process. These results do not permit the classification of 'Pedro Sato' guava as a traditional climacteric fruit."}

This essay attempts to demonstrate that such a decentralized system is capable of encouraging local governments to improve the quality and efficiency of basic education. This is possible if the central government is involved in designing specific countervailing policies to reduce the negative impact of unequal access to education and sorting phenomenon on human capital accumulation for low-income families.

More recently, the interest in manipulation of biological pathways has intensified in a bid to stall or halt disease progression . Studies with lenalidomide have exemplified the promise of early intervention, whereas numerous therapeutic approaches remain the subject of ongoing clinical investigation.

A vaccine is biologically made from inactive components of microbes, to enhance immunity and as a defense mechanism adverse to parasitic, bacterial and viral illnesses. Nonetheless, the mode of production that involves purification is quite costly, more so, to low and middle-income countries, especially in Africa. Conventional oral cholera vaccines, though commercially available, face logistical challenges to be transported and distributed to target populations such as Africa. Edible vaccines derived from plants, on the other hand, offer cost-effective and bio-friendly production cost, they are easily administered to all age groups and can be grown near-user-site. This article thoroughly assesses the capability of plant-based edible vaccines as an option for immunization against cholera with exclusive concentration on the African continent."}

Ableism, “compulsory able-bodiedness” (Campbell, 2009; McRuer, 2013), will be used as an interrogative tool to aid in the ‘outing’ of the ‘able’: to tease out the values and principles undergirding this exclusionary perception of motherhood. As such I will be drawing on autoethnographic material, in conjunction with a Studies in Ableism (SiA; Campbell, 2009) approach to analyse the bypassing of disabled mothers and to suggest tentative ways forward. In the UK 1.7 million parents identify as disabled (Morris &amp; Wates, 2006) and perhaps many more would do so if there were no fear of censure (see, especially, Booth &amp; Booth, 2005; Llewellyn, McConell, &amp; Ferronato, 2003; Sheerin, 2001; Swain, French, &amp; Cameron, 2003) and their requirements need to be recognised, heard and provided for in the consumer market. The following article will articulate how disabled mothers are barred from the sacred hallow of motherhood, and delineate the need for the media, governmental organisations and marketing corporations to address their culpability in this blatant discrimination."}

The test environment approached prototype conditions with the use of construction camp trailers as test units and large existing sheltered enclosures. Empirical relationships were developed for evaluating the components of net heat loss, namely, conductance, infiltration, and solar gain. A shelter benefit related to exposed wind velocity was derived for shelters of varying densities. Study results indicated a sizeable reduction in winter heating load through the use of good quality shelterbelts. The reduction was found to vary directly with exposed wind velocity and shelter density. For the winter seasonal average wind velocity of 22.3 km/h for Regina, Saskatchewan, the reduction varied from 17.5% for the most permeable test shelter to 25% for the densest test shelter..</p>"}

This study investigated the determinants of the adoption of academic e-books by university students in Nigeria. Results showed that a majority of students were aware of electronic books but only 44.5% of students used them often. Despite the availability of these resources, more than 50% of students did not use e-books, also surprising was that majority of students discovered e-books from their lecturers. The study further revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions were major determinants in the adoption of e-books by undergraduate students. However, social influence and gender did play a significant role in the intention to adopt electronic books by undergraduate students. This study has practical implications on academic institutions and electronic book publishers in encouraging e-book use and improving e-book features to align with the needs of the millennial students and also providing reliable internet facilities and improving lecturer and institutional support in driving e-book adoption by undergraduate students."}

But Gye and Barnard have shown that ultramicroscopic organisms occur in (and can be cultivated from) the fluids derived from—at least—some cancerous tissues. Such ultramicroscopic organisms also exhibit specificity. Let Robertson's hypothesis be accepted, then it is a reasonable assumption, which can probably be tested, that these ultramicroscopic organisms may primarily be feeding on the products of autocatalysis in the tissues in which they are found. If, therefore, these organisms could be cultivated in fluids derived from healthy tissues homologous with those from which they were derived, or even in the tissues themselves, partial proof of the assumption would be obtained."}

In general, increasing c progressively favored diffusion and/or adsorption at the interface and formation of finer emulsions; increasing the energy input level of emulsification improved the emulsification efficiency and extent of droplet flocculation, as well as the emulsion coalescence and creaming stability. The rheological and creaming behavior of these emulsions was predominately determined by the amount of proteins adsorbed at the interface. The results confirmed that these nanoparticles can formulate Pickering emulsions with properties tailored by selecting c and the emulsification process."}

Four specimens had been tested using pull-out test. Each specimen consisted of a CFST column with a thin steel tube thickness of 2mm and attached to a T-stub type of connection. All columns and connections are fastened by M20 grade 8.8 with 110mm and 150mm longitudinal spacing between bolts whereas the thicknesses of T-stub end plate are 10mm and 12mm thick end-plate. The monotonic pull-out loading test was used until the specimens reached failure. Based on test results, the ultimate load for all specimens shows a similar behaviour with the Eurocode 3 standard. It can be concluded that the thin-walled CFST column is shown to be reliable to be used for tensile resisting composite frame structures especially for medium to high rise structures."}

Green water, a leading component of water resources, accounted for more than 69.00% of the total water resources in Ningxia. Blue water and green water showed a single peak trend on the monthly and annual scales during the study period. On the spatial scale, the southern region of Ningxia showed higher blue water and green water resources than the northern region. The spatiotemporal distribution features of blue water, green water, and green water flow had strong correlations with precipitation. Furthermore, the simulation identified the climate change in Ningxia to be more influential on blue water and green water than land-use changes. This study provides a specific scientific foundation to manage water resources in Ningxia when encountered with climate change together with human activities."}

The primary cause of this condition is mostly linked to persistent infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which are recognized for their ability to promote the development of cancer. Due to HPV infection, both therapeutic and preventative HPV vaccinations have been developed. Therapeutic vaccines can eradicate viruses and virus-infected cells by stimulating cellular immunity. Notwithstanding the availability of preventive HPV vaccinations, HPV screening, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the therapeutic effect on cervical cancer patients is limited. Therefore, therapeutic vaccines have emerged as a new treatment option. The cancer-causing proteins E6 and E7, which are consistently detected in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions, are crucial in the progression and sustenance of cervical cancer. Consequently, these cancer-causing proteins present an encouraging opportunity for the research and creation of therapeutic cervical cancer vaccines. The multiple therapeutic vaccines against cervical cancer will be briefly discussed in this article, including their mechanisms, development methods, and clinical effects."}

Methods: The outcomes after portoenterostomy for biliary atresia from 1976 to 1996 were graded\n         into 3 defined groups: G (good, jaundice free); I (intermediate, progressive liver\n         disease with liver transplant if needed after 3 years of age); P (poor, liver transplant\n         or death at less than 3 years of age). Results: Twenty-seven of 49 children (55%) who underwent portoenterostomy responded. Of these,\n         13 (26%) were jaundice free (G). Of 14 children (28%) in I, 6 underwent liver transplant\n         after 3 years of age. Of 22 children (44.8%) in P, 14 (28%) died before 3 years and\n         8 underwent liver transplant before 3 years. Thus, 42% of the children in this series\n         are surviving with native liver. Age at operation in P was significantly different\n         compared with G. Preoperative values of bilirubin and alanine transaminase were comparable\n         in the 3 groups. Postoperative values of bilirubin and alanine transaminase were lower\n         in G and I compared with P. Complications were significantly lower in group G. Conclusions: Portoenterostomy alone in biliary atresia is beneficial in 40% of cases. Factors\n         associated with the outcome include age at operation, postoperative cholangitis, and\n         change in values of bilirubin and alanine transaminase. A classification based on\n         decline of bilirubin and enzyme levels 3 months after portoenterostomy is proposed\n         to predict the long-term outcome of an individual case of biliary atresia.

Current existing drugs cause several side effects and resistance, the identification of new therapeutic targets for the development of new drugs is necessary. The vesicular trafficking in the parasite flagellar pocket is essential for parasite survival and proliferation, but little is known about the proteins involved in the endocytic/secretory pathways. In this work, we are describing the characterization of a transporter cargo protein SFT-2/Got-1 like in Leishmania infantum. Material and Methods: Using bioinformatics tools, the putative Got-1 protein A4HSK3 was characterized structurally and phylogenetically. Molecular biology was used to clone and express the protein and confocal fluorescence to determine its subcellular localization. Results: The Got-1 like protein presents four alpha helix TM conserved domains (aa38-aa147) characteristics of the Got-1/SFT-2 family proteins and an important Pen-2 conserved motif LGDYXXF located in the extracellular loop. Confocal microscopy suggests that Got-1/SFT-2 like is localized in the flagellar pocket, and is partially co-localized with the L. infantum presenilin-like protein. Phylogenetically, the Leishmania sp Got-1 like is contained in a subgroup of proteins clearly detached from the other Trypanosomatidae, such as T. cruzi and T. brucei. Conclusions: Our data show the presence of an important transported proteins, and its colocalization with the presenilin aspartyl protease in the flagellar pocket of the L. infantum open new perspectives to identify novel targets, which can be an alternative therapeutic strategy against leishmaniasis."}

An inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) function led to a perturbation in the expression of key genes in thyroid hormone synthesis and release pathways. The clinically used thiourea drugs, methimazole (MMI) and 6-n-propyl-2-thioruacil (PTU), were used to evaluate thyroid drug response in these models. Inhibition of TPO occurred early as shown in rat thyroid lobes (2 h) and was sustained in both rat (24–48 h) and human (24 h) with ≥ 10 μM MMI. Thyroid from rats treated with single doses of MMI (30–1000 mg/kg) exhibited sustained TPO inhibition at 48 h. The MMI in vivo thyroid concentrations were comparable to the culture concentrations (~ 15–84 μM), thus demonstrating a close correlation between in vivo and ex vivo thyroid effects. A compensatory response to TPO inhibition was demonstrated in the rat thyroid lobe with significant up-regulation of genes involved in the pathway of thyroid hormone synthesis ( Tpo, Dio1, Slc5a5, Tg , Tshr) and the megalin release pathway ( Lrp2) by 24 h with MMI (≥ 10 μM) and PTU (100 μM). Similarly, thyroid from the rat in vivo study exhibited an up-regulation of Dio1, Slc5a5, Lrp2, and Tshr . In human thyroid slices, there were few gene expression changes ( Slc5a5 , ~ 2-fold) and only at higher MMI concentrations (≥ 1500 μM, 24 h). Extended exposure (48 h) resulted in up-regulation of Tpo , Dio1 and Lrp2 , along with Slc5a5 and Tshr . In summary, TPO was inhibited by similar MMI concentrations in rat and human tissue, however an increased sensitivity to drug treatment in rat is indicated by the up-regulation of thyroid hormone synthesis and release gene pathways at concentrations found not to affect human tissue. ► Novel model of rat thyroid or human thyroid slices to evaluate pathways of injury. ► TPO inhibition by MMI or PTU altered hormone synthesis and release genes. ► Rat thyroid was more sensitive to the drug effects than human tissue."}

Aristotle seems to consider the theory of syllogism and the theory of demonstration a unitary whole, the former serving as an indispensable stage for developing the latter. Throughout the Posterior Analytics syllogistic inferences exemplify and elucidate the various features of demonstrative knowledge. For instance, in the second book of the Posterior Analytics the attainment of knowledge of the reason why is characterized as a search for a middle term; in the Posterior Analytics I.14 the first syllogistic figure is said to be the most suitable for attaining knowledge (epistêmonikon malista); and Aristotle’s distinction between knowledge of the fact and knowledge of the reason why is exemplified by syllogistic inferences. Generally, syllogistic inferences appear to be integral to the theory of demonstrative knowledge."}

Methods: Retrospective analysis of SDAVF patients in a period of three years (2019 to 2021) who presented with progressive paraparesis, bladder symptoms, and/or sensory disturbances. They were evaluated by MRI and localization of the fistula was done by spinal catheter angiogram. Spinal AV fistulas were simply classified as extradural and intradural. They all underwent microsurgical shunt interruption. Neurological function was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue Scale (ALS). Individual ALS scores of each patient (pretreatment and post-treatment) were recorded to find out the p-value of the surgical intervention. Results: A total of 20 patients (mean age 35 ± 10 years, 16 (80.0%) are male. The mean interval from onset to diagnosis was 6 ± 3 months. Among the anatomical location of fistulas, 1(05.0%) was cervical, 16 (80.0%) were in thoracic, and 3 (15.0%) were lumbar. Among the angiographic types of fistulas, 18(90.0%) were intradural and, 2 (10.0%) were extradural. Compared with pre-operative ALS scores,15 (75.00%) patients received improvement, and 05 (25.00%) patients felt worse or more stable. Among 20 surgical procedures, there were complications in three cases (15%): epidural hematoma in 1 case, cerebrospinal fluid leakage in 1 case, and postoperative wound infection in 1 case. Conclusions: In our study, microsurgical interruption of timely diagnosed SDAVF showed good and stable results over time."}

In the current study, we examined whether chronic metabolic acidosis, which increases ammonia metabolism, alters the cell-specific and/or the subcellular expression of the ammonia transporter family member, Rhcg, in the outer medullary collecting duct in the inner stripe (OMCDi). Chronic metabolic acidosis was induced in normal SD rats by HCl ingestion for 7 days; controls were pair-fed. The subcellular distribution of Rhcg was determined using immunogold electron microscopy and morphometric analyses. In intercalated cells, acidosis increased total Rhcg, apical plasma membrane Rhcg, and the proportion of total cellular Rhcg in the apical plasma membrane. Intracellular Rhcg decreased significantly, and basolateral Rhcg was unchanged. Because apical plasma membrane length increased in parallel with apical Rhcg immunolabel, apical plasma membrane Rhcg density was unchanged. In principal cells, acidosis increased total Rhcg, apical plasma membrane Rhcg, and the proportion of total cellular Rhcg in the apical plasma membrane while decreasing the intracellular proportion. In contrast to the intercalated cell, chronic metabolic acidosis did not significantly alter apical boundary length; accordingly, apical plasma membrane Rhcg density increased. In addition, basolateral Rhcg immunolabel increased in response to chronic metabolic acidosis. These results indicate that in the rat OMCDi 1) chronic metabolic acidosis increases apical plasma membrane Rhcg in both the intercalated cell and principal cell where it may contribute to enhanced apical ammonia secretion; 2) increased apical plasma membrane Rhcg results from both increased total protein and changes in the subcellular distribution of Rhcg; 3) the mechanism of Rhcg subcellular redistribution differs in intercalated and principal cells; and 4) Rhcg may contribute to regulated basolateral ammonia transport in the principal cell."}

Feature selection is a significant preprocessing method in the classification part of an expert system. We propose a new Multiswarm Heterogeneous Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (MHBPSO) using a Win-Win approach to improve the performance of Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (BPSO) for feature selection. MHBPSO is a cooperation algorithm, which includes BPSO and its three variants such as Boolean PSO (BoPSO), Self Adjusted Hierarchical Boolean PSO (SAHBoPSO), and Catfish Self Adjusted Hierarchical Boolean PSO (CSAHBoPSO). It performs heterogeneous search on the entire solution space using four different algorithms. Each algorithm shares global best information to another algorithm to select the preeminent global best position. A variant of BoPSO, SAHBoPSO is proposed, in which leaders are identified based on the fitness values for guiding remaining particles and thus forms the hierarchical structure of leaders and its followers. Meanwhile leaders and followers are changed dynamically and consequently changed the hierarchical structure. CSAHBoPSO, which is the version of SAHBoPSO, is also proposed to avoid stagnation in the subsequent iterations. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithms CEC 2013 benchmark functions are employed. In order to validate the proposed algorithms, comparative study with BPSO, BoPSO, VPSO (Mirjalili and Lewis, 2013), HBPSOGA (Wang et al., 2018) and CatfishBPSO (Chuang et al., 2011a) is provided. Experimental results show that SAHBoPSO and CSAHBoPSO algorithm based on BoPSO are promising and significantly better than BPSO, BoPSO, and VPSO. MHBPSO shows the superior improvement in the search ability. In addition, proposed algorithms are tested in the feature selection phase of intelligent liver and kidney cancer diagnostic systems to select elite features from the liver and kidney cancer data. Findings show that the proposed system is proficient in selecting the elite features to classify the tumor as benign or malignant with minimum error rates."}

Firstly, this review focuses on FRET probes wherein both the donor and acceptor are fluorescence proteins and are incorporated into a single molecule, i.e. unimolecular probes. Advantages of these probes lie in their easy loading into cells, the simple acquisition of FRET images, and the clear evaluation of data. Next, we introduce our recent study which encompasses FRET imaging and in silico simulation. In nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, we found positive and negative signaling feedback loops. We propose that these feedback loops determine neurite-budding sites. We would like to emphasize that it is now time to accelerate crossover research in neuroscience, optics, and computational biology."}

The radiological archive was searched for patients with ablated HCAs and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging between January 2008 and June 2014. Age, sex, risk factors and duration of clinical and imaging follow-up were recorded. Pre-RFA imaging was assessed for tumour size, intra-tumoral fat and steatosis. Post-RFA imaging was reviewed for size, enhancement and intra-ablational fat. Intra-ablational fat was classified as peripheral, central or mixed; the association of these distributions with steatosis and tumoral fat was assessed using Fisher’s exact test. Sixteen patients with 26 ablated HCAs were included. Fat was present in 23/26 (88 %) ablation zones. Only 1/26 (4 %) showed serial enlargement and enhancement suggestive of residual disease; the enhancing area did not contain fat. All remaining ablations showed involution and/or diminishing fat content without suspicious enhancement (mean follow-up, 27 months; range, 2–84 months). The peripheral and mixed/central patterns of intra-ablational fat were associated with steatosis (P = 0.0005) and tumoral fat (P = 0.0003), respectively. Fat in the ablation zone of HCAs is a common finding which, in isolation, does not indicate residual tumour. • Fat in the RFA zone of HCAs is a common finding on MRI. • The distribution of fat is associated with hepatic steatosis and intra-tumoral fat. • In isolation, intra-ablational fat of treated HCAs does not indicate residual tumour."}

By Trial 30, adjusted vertical lines did not differ from the length of the horizontal line. Other subjects were first tested on the small inverted-T figure and then asked to produce 1-in. lines in the vertical plane and in the horizontal plane. These subjects also improved on the adjustment task but, on the production task, were no more accurate than control subjects who were not given practice on the adjustment task. Thus, the magnitude of the Horizontal-Vertical Illusion decreases with practice alone and this practice effect readily transfers to figures of other sizes but not to an alternate form of the illusion.

This idea is criticized as too constraining on possible alternatives to quantum gravity.

Some numerical results are presented for the antenna admittance for the sheathless case, where the uniform magnetoplasma is in contact with the antenna surface. The admittance values are obtained from a numerical integration of the Fourier integral for the antenna current, and are given for plasma parameter values typical of the E region of the ionosphere.The admittance values obtained exhibit a maximum slightly above the electron cyclotron frequency, and in this regard are similar to the admittance when the magnetoplasma is incompressible but separated from the antenna by a free-space layer (the vacuum sheath). In addition, the admittance is found to have a slight minimum at the plasma frequency and to have a more pronounced minimum at the upper hybrid frequency where also the susceptance changes sign, these minima not being significantly affected by the plasma compressibility or vacuum sheath. These features of the calculated admittances are found to have a qualitative resemblance to experimental results obtained from antenna measurements in the ionosphere."}

Eight recreationally active men (high-intensity cardiorespiratory training > 3 times per week, > 6 months) completed two exercise sessions (5 sets of 5 cycling sprints, 150% max W), preceded by either IPC (3 × 5 min leg occlusions at 220 mmHg) or SHAM (3 × 5 min at 20 mmHg). Knee extensor maximal force and rate of force were measured before (PRE), immediately post (POST), 1H, and 24H after cycling. Twitch interpolation and resting potentiated twitches were applied to estimate voluntary activation and muscle contractility, respectively. Quadriceps H-reflex recruitment curves were collected at all time-points using 10 Hz doublet stimulation to allow estimation of H-reflex post-activation depression. Surface electromyograms and tissue oxygenation (via near-infrared spectroscopy) were continuously recorded during cycling. IPC did not affect any measure of neuromuscular function or performance during cycling. Maximal force and muscle contractility were significantly lower at POST and 1H compared to PRE and 24H by up to 50% (p < 0.01). Maximal force was lower than PRE at 24H by 8.7% (p = 0.028). Voluntary activation and rate of force were unchanged. A rightwards shift was observed for the H-reflex recruitment curve POST, and post-activation depression was higher than all other time-points at 24H (p < 0.05). Muscle activation and oxygenation decreased during cycling. IPC has a nominal effect on mechanisms associated with neuromuscular function during and after exercise in healthy populations."}

Time-course changes in the imaging results, with confirmatory quantitative liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis for each 1-mm segment of single hair strands, revealed a substantial concentration of the drug first onto the hair bulbs after ingestion, while only a small portion appeared to be incorporated into the hair matrix, forming a 2–3 mm distinctive drug band with tailing. Comparable amount of the drug also appeared to be incorporated into the keratinized hair shaft in the upper dermis zone, forming another distinct drug band of about 2 mm, which both moved toward the distal side, following the strand’s growth rate. These findings provide forensically crucial information: there are two major drug incorporation sites, at least for MOP, which cause overlap of the recordings and deteriorates its chronological resolution down to about 11 days or perhaps longer."}

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) have become recognized as a byproduct of wildfires and an important indicator of ancient wildfires. However, the factors controlling wildfires remain elusive. This study presents analyses of PAH compounds found in 22 surface soil samples from the snow-capped Mount Yulong (Mt. Yulong), on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP; 1906 ∼ 4132 m above sea level (asl)), as well as the total organic carbon (TOC) and n -alkanes values for these soils. This area is climatically influenced by alternating Westerlies as well as the Southwest Asian Monsoon and the Southeast Asian Monsoon. PAH ratios, including the indeno[1,2,3- cd ]pyrene/(indeno[1,2,3- cd ]pyrene + benzo[ g , h , i ]perylene) and fluoranthene/ (fluoranthene + pyrene) ratios, as well as the ratios of low molecular weight (LMW) PAH to high molecular weight (HMW) PAH (LMW/HMW) and the LMW/∑PAH ratio, can reliably confirm that these PAH were primarily produced by biomass combustion. Further principal component analysis (PCA) also supported this conclusion. The highest ∑PAH concentration (Conc PAH 89.9 ng/g) from sites >3800 m asl that exhibit significant wildfire remains further confirming that PAH can be taken as a reliable indicator of the occurrence of ancient wildfires. Analysis of variance confirmed that the composition of local vegetation type has a minimal contribution to Conc PAH across the study area, but soil type played an obvious effect on Conc PAH as the result of change in absorb ability of PAH. When analyzing samples that had no wildfire remains, there was no correlation between Conc PAH and mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation (MAP). The relatively lower prevalence of wildfire activity (indicated by a low mean Conc PAH value of 21.29 ± 9.80 ng/g) along the Mt. Yulong transect between 2200 and 3500 m asl may be due to a wetter climate (with MAP between 800 and 1800 mm in the rainy season), a climate which would in turn have reduced the combustibility of vegetation fuel and thus limited wildfire activity. Indeed, the highest standardized dimethylphenanthrene ratio (0.76 ± 1.16), Retene/3-ring (0.81 ± 0.66) and Retene (0.63 ± 1.03 ng/g) values all presented between 2200 and 3500 m asl, confirming their reliability as indicators of conifer combustion. • PAH, TOC and n -alkanes in 22 surface soil samples were quantified along the altitudinal transect in Mt. Yulong. • Ratios analysis and PCA confirm that these parent PAH were primarily produced by biomass combustion. • Conc PAH values were affected by wildfire occurrence, preservation environment, and soil types. • DMPy, Ret/3-ring and Ret (ng/g) can be used as indicators of conifer combustion."}

Die Faktorkorrelationen über die Instrumente hinweg lagen zwischen |.61| und |.96| (nur Attitude Subskala des SACIE). Alle Subskalen zeigen vergleichbare Zusammenhänge mit Selbstwirksamkeit und den Big Five Persönlichkeitsfaktoren.

This study focuses on genetic variation using 10 SSRs (11 unlinked loci) from clonally propagated cultivars (574 accessions) of European chestnut (Castanea sativa) and hybrids (71 accessions). They were compared with a representative sample of exotic chestnut species present in the Atlantic area, 47 accessions of Castanea crenata, 37 of Castanea mollissima and 33 of Castanea henryi. Accessions were analysed using a model-based Bayesian procedure (Structure), factorial correspondence analysis and analysis of molecular variance. The main chestnut species, hybrids and alien introgressions were differentiated. Two main origins of variability in European cultivated chestnut were found in the Iberian Peninsula, one in the North and a second in the Centre.

The framework is calibrated with historical data collected from the APV system at the Jeollanamdo Agricultural Research and Extension Services (35.0161° N, 126.7108° E) in South Korea.

This study aimed to develop drug nanocrystals to enhance the aqueous solubility of firocoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of pain in the veterinary field. Different non-ionic stabilizers were evaluated to obtain firocoxib nanocrystals with reduced particle size, increased saturation solubility, and adequate storage stability. Optimization using the Box-Behnken design resulted in nanocrystals with a particle size of < 200 nm. In vitro dissolution testing demonstrated a 1.5-fold increase in drug dissolution compared to the pure drug. Safety assessment in Galleria mellonella L. larvae revealed any acute toxicity below a dosage of 50 times. In the pharmacokinetic study in beagle dogs, the nanocrystals improved C max in 2x compared to commercial product. Physicochemical stability was maintained over 12 months, with reduced variability in particle size and a PdI < 0.3. Additionally, an exploratory scale-up study successfully produced 3000 g of firocoxib nanocrystals with particle size < 400 nm.

Our study aimed to analyze the effect of aging on six nanohybrid RBCs, of which two are using these new types of monomers, with regard to differences in the mechanical properties of the materials. Diametral tensile strength (DTS), Vickers hardness (HV), and creep were measured. Mechanical tests were performed after storing samples for 24 h in distilled water, as well as after aging (thermocycling for 5,000 cycles at 5–55°C and storage for 4 weeks either in distilled water, artificial saliva, or ethanol). The effect of aging on all test parameters was lower than the effect of the material. This information was provided by a general linear model, showing higher partial η2 values for the influence factor material than for the factor aging. The influence of aging on the micromechanical properties HV and creep was proven to be more sensitive than on the macromechanical property (DTS). This was also illustrated by lower η2 values for the variable aging for DTS. An increase of the creep of all materials was observed after storage in alcohol. The use of new types of monomers could not be shown to be a significant advantage to the other examined materials containing BisGMA. Nanohybrid composites can be recommended as universal filling materials, whether based on new or conventional monomers."}

The research proposes a mental health assessment model for college students that integrates facial expression recognition and deep learning technology, combining dynamic and static facial expression information to raise the accuracy and efficiency of recognition. This model is based on a dual branch structure, using a hierarchical sliding window Transformer with optical flow graph input to extract dynamic features, and MobileViT with convolution and attention fusion to extract static peak frame features. Cross branch feature interaction and fusion are achieved through a cross attention module. The findings denote that the accuracy of the proposed model reaches 0.945, the F1 value is 0.934, and the AUC value is as high as 0.963. At the same time, the average response time of the model is only 2.2 s, and the training time is 2.6 s, which has better computational efficiency while ensuring accuracy. The proposed method shows significant advantages in the accuracy of abnormal state recognition, training stability, and generalization ability. The research results indicate that the fusion model can serve as an effective supplement to the psychological health warning system in universities, providing intelligent technical support for emotion recognition driven psychological interventions."}

Defined as a functional injury, concussion is characterised by a constellation of signs and symptoms. However, clinical imaging methods do not reveal any structural damage. Recently, neurophysiological techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are being applied to quantify functional changes following concussion, both from an acute perspective, but also to investigate chronic changes associated with concussion injuries. The aim of this review paper is to present a state of art review on studies using TMS to assess concussion. \n(2) Methods: Systematic searching of relevant databases for peer-reviewed literature between 1985 to present day. A qualitative synthesis of studies attaining the inclusion criteria was conducted. \n(3) Results: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. TMS study checklist rated studies of moderate to high methodological quality. Nine studies reported short-term data following concussion, while 13 studies reported long-term changes in those with persistent symptoms or chronic changes with history of head trauma. Majority of studies reported alterations or abnormalities in intracortical inhibition.\n(4) Conclusions:  This review demonstrates that TMS is a reliable and sophisticated technique to measure the neurophysiology of concussion. While further studies are required to establish effectiveness TMS as a clinical tool for mild brain injury, the potential of TMS to reliably quantify cortical activity offers exciting opportunities to provide objective measures for concussion diagnosis and prognosis."}

The structural transition of nano-CuFe2O4 from tetragonal to cubic was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The theoretical derivations and experimental tests indicate that, as the size decreases, the temperature, the enthalpy, and the entropy of the structural transition of nano-CuFe2O4 decrease accordingly and present linear variation with the reciprocal of size, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of particle sizes on the magnetic properties of nano-CuFe2O4 was investigated.

Existing tools for assessing walkability in high-density cities primarily focus on the immediate environment of sidewalks.

Consequently, based on a systematic analysis of the features of high-density cities, this study proposes the High-density Environment Assessment Tool (HEAT). This hybrid approach comprehensively assesses walkability in high-density cities by incorporating variables of neighborhood, segment (sidewalk), and crossing. The HEAT consisted of three sections with 108 items. To validate the reliability and applicability, field tests were conducted in two 15-min walkable neighborhoods with different built environment contexts in Chongqing City, China. The neighborhood section was objectively assessed using ArcGIS Software. The segment section and crossing section were audited through systematic on-site observation. Four pairs of trained raters assessed all of the segments (n = 139) and crossings (n = 123) within the two neighborhoods. The inter-rater reliability of the repeated audit data was evaluated by Kappa/Weighted Kappa or Percentage Agreement values. A web-based application was used for data collection and input. For the neighborhood section, 21 assessment items were included. For the segment and crossing sections, 87 assessment items were included for the reliability test, and 84 (96.6%) of the items indicated satisfying inter-rater reliability (with Kappa/Weighted Kappa value ≥ 0.4 or high Percentage Agreement). In addition, the audit of each segment and crossing sample was completed in an average of 7.9 and 1.8 min, respectively. The results indicated that the HEAT was reliable and efficient. The HEAT provided an effective tool for assessing the walkability of the neighborhood built environment in high-density cities, thereby facilitating environmental interventions aimed at promoting walking activities. • The HEAT is designed to assess neighborhood walkability in high-density cities. • The HEAT is a hybrid approach including neighborhood, segment, and crossing levels. • 96.6% of the on-site auditing items indicate satisfying reliability. • The training manual and web-based app are adopted to improve efficiency."}

This species plays an essential role in local stockbreeding and breeding newer species. Its population has been declining rapidly over the past few years owing to poor understanding of the significance of conservation of germplasm resources and the introduction of abundant species. To effectively protect and wisely utilise cattle breed resources, researchers have performed extensive studies on genetic diversity of domestic animals. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Shigaste humped cattle was successfully obtained by Illumina Hiseq Xten platform. The circular genome is 16,340 bp, which is composed of 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes and a control region. Base composition of the genome is A (33.4%), C (26.0%), G (13.4%), T (27.2%), with an A + T content of 60.6%. Phylogenetic relationship based on 10 mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that Shigaste humped cattle was clustered with domestic cattle from China, and was closely related to Bos indicus. This study provided detailed molecular genetic information for the conservation and utilization of cattle germplasm resources."}

In toluene, hydrogenation proceeds at a significantly higher rate on Pd-alumina catalyst than on Pt-alumina. In AcOH, hydrogenation is fast on both catalysts. There was no significant difference between the selectivities of diastereomer formation on Pd and Pt catalysts. The presence of cinchonidine (CD) and cinchonine (CN) reduced the hydrogenation rate of β-ICNN and had no effect on the stereoselectivity of hydrogenation.

The maximum peak ground acceleration of 353 cm/sec2 was recorded at an accelerograph located at the Gopeshwar station at an approximate epicentral distance of 14 km. The simplified method of Midorikawa (1993) has been used to model finite fault responsible for causing the Chamoli earthquake. This method is based on the Empirical Green's Function (EGF) technique of Irikura (1986).Modifications in this method have been made to include layered earth model and transmission effects at each boundary by Joshi (2001). Rupture causing the Chamoli earthquake is placed in two structural models of the earth in this work: one is a homogeneous half space and other is the multi layered earth model. Comparison in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) is made between the simulated and actual strong motion parameters like peak acceleration and duration. It is seen that the introduction of multi layered earth system in this simplified technique is capable of significantly reducing the RMSE in observed and predicted strong motion parameters and defining the attenuation rate for peak ground acceleration of this earthquake."}

To enhance the operational safety of shale gas gathering systems and address the complex and unpredictable nature of pipe wall erosion, this work investigated the erosion behavior of pipelines through comparative friction and erosion experiments using steel pipes and five anti-erosion materials. The erosion mechanism of steel pipes was revealed, and zirconia was identified as the optimal erosion-resistant layer material based on its superior anti-wear and anti-erosion performance. A gas–liquid–solid three-phase flow mathematical model has been established to simulate the entire life-cycle erosion process. The simulation results elucidate the particle motion characteristics and erosion patterns under continuously varying phase ratios. Comparison between the steel substrate and zirconia-layered pipe indicates that the erosion rate of steel increases sharply during the early service stage, while that of the zirconia layer remains nearly stable, resulting in a 73% reduction in maximum erosion rate. Field application tests of the erosion-resistant pipes in shale gas gathering systems demonstrated that the service life was extended from 7 days to 3 months, and post-service inspection showed the layer still retained protective capability. This work provides theoretical insights and engineering guidance for anti-erosion design and service life extension of shale gas gathering pipelines. "}

Yet so far, we have no molecular map of the human brain vasculature. Here we develop vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) to profile the major vascular and perivascular cell types of the human brain through 143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9 individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and 8 individuals with no cognitive impairment. We identify brain-region- and species-enriched genes and pathways. We reveal molecular principles of human arteriovenous organization, recapitulating a gradual endothelial and punctuated mural cell continuum. We discover two subtypes of human pericytes, marked by solute transport and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization; and define perivascular versus meningeal fibroblast specialization. In Alzheimer’s disease, we observe selective vulnerability of ECM-maintaining pericytes and gene expression patterns that implicate dysregulated blood flow. With an expanded survey of brain cell types, we find that 30 of the top 45 genes that have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease risk by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are expressed in the human brain vasculature, and we confirm this by immunostaining. Vascular GWAS genes map to endothelial protein transport, adaptive immune and ECM pathways. Many are microglia-specific in mice, suggesting a partial evolutionary transfer of Alzheimer’s disease risk. Our work uncovers the molecular basis of the human brain vasculature, which will inform our understanding of overall brain health, disease and therapy. A method called vessel isolation and nuclei extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) produces a molecular map of vascular and perivascular cell types in the human brain and reveals their contributions to Alzheimer’s disease risk."}

The electrochemical deionization (ECDI) method has emerged as a promising avenue to solve this pressing issue. Among various ECDI systems, conducting polymers have showcased a remarkable potential for the electrode materials due to their facile large-scale synthesis and precise control over the removal of both anions and cations. In this study, we scrutinize the impact of diverse dopant sizes on the intrinsic properties of polypyrrole (PPy) chains, leading to the development of a high-performance ECDI system. By the incorporation of para-substituted groups featuring elongated carbon chains, such as dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS), the PPy-DBS-1//PPy-ClO4 configuration attains an excited salt-adsorption capacity (SAC) of 61.7 mg g-1 in the 10 mM NaCl solution and sustains a low energy consumption of 0.22 kWh/kg-NaCl. Our research findings accentuate the pivotal fact that the dopant size and type play key roles in enhancing the ions transport ability and the mobility of charge carriers within the conducting polymer framework. Moreover, fine-tuning the doping ratio emerges as a strategic approach that enhances the cation capture ability of the electrodes and sustains their cycling stability. Overall, these insights into the symbiotic relationship between dopants and the PPy framework within the ECDI system provide a guiding framework for augmenting the electrode performance of conducting polymers with dopants and expanding the potential applications of conducting polymers in the ECDI field.

Revitalizations of cultural traditions among the Grenadian population provide avenues of heritage commemorations to counter the continuing impacts of those oppressive contexts. This chapter explores the visual arts and related elements of heritage in Grenada to draw attention to the historical suppression of the artistic talents of Grenadians and the resulting dissipation of cultural traditions. This injustice has its roots in colonialism and slavery, during which organized art and cultural practices were suppressed for many Grenadian people. The practice of the arts, for example, was reserved for colonial elites. Yet, cultural practices and vernacular craft forms among middle and lower socio-economic classes in Grenada adapted inspirations from cultural influences in regions of Africa, Asia, and Europe. A wide-spread and vernacular adaption of international art styles was practiced in Grenada and neighboring islands from the late nineteenth century onward in the form of the rich mahogany wood structure of an ample armchair in many households. Among these elements of tangible heritage, this chapter promotes a revitalization of the Grenadian version of furnishings to provide elements of commemoration of past, shared, traditions."}

A series of compounds from Vitex negundo have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various diseases. Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive malignancies. A significant feature of melanoma is its resistance to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy; therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments for melanoma. We first examined the effects of VB1 (vitexin compound 1) on cell viability by CCK-8 (cell counting kit) and Colony Formation Assay; And then, we analyzed the apoptosis and cell cycle by flow cytometry, verified apoptosis by Immunoblotting. The in vivo effect of VB1 was evaluated in xenograft mouse model. Potential mechanisms of VB1’s antitumor effects were explored by RNA sequencing and the key differential expression genes were validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Finally, the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was detected by flow cytometry, and the DNA damage was revealed by Immunofluorescence and Immunoblotting. In this study, we show that VB1, which is a compound purified from the seed of the Chinese herb Vitex negundo, blocks melanoma cells growth in vitro and in vivo, arrests the cell cycle in G2/M phase and induces apoptosis in melanoma cell lines, whereas the effects are not significantly observed in normal cells. To study the details of VB1, we analyzed the alteration of gene expression profiles after treatment with VB1 in melanoma cells. The findings showed that VB1 can affect various pathways, including p53, apoptosis and the cell cycle pathway, in a variety of melanoma cell lines. Furthermore, we confirmed that VB1 restored the P53 pathway protein level, and then we demonstrated that VB1 significantly induced the accumulation of ROS, which resulted in DNA damage in melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, our results showed that VB1 also increased the ROS levels in BRAFi (BRAF inhibitor)-resistant melanoma cells, leading to DNA cytotoxicity, which caused G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that vitexin compound 1 might be a promising therapeutic Chinese medicine for melanoma treatment regardless of BRAFi resistance."}

In order to overcome the difficulties related to the nonlinear nature of the problem, an approximate solution of the above problem is proposed in terms of a hierarchy of linear integral equations. In particular, the solution at the first order is here investigated and applied to a class of uniform vortices, the kinematics of which is well known. A rich mathematical phenomenology has been found behind the approximate dynamics. In particular, the motion of certain branch points and the consequent changes in the algebraic structure of the Schwarz function appear to be its key features. The approximate solutions are finally compared with the contour dynamics simulations of the vortex motion. The agreement is satisfactory up to times of the order of a quarter of the eddy turnover time, while it becomes more and more qualitative at later times. Eventually, the physical meaning of the approximate solutions is lost, the corresponding vortex boundaries becoming non-simple curves."}

The paper provides a working definition of the term, outlines why it has become controversial, and uses case studies to examine success and failures of extraordinary rendition in practice. The paper concludes with lessons learned—more specifically, policy amendments—that are necessary to keep extraordinary rendition as a viable tool for the Obama Administration and mitigate political fallout against the United States from both its allies and enemies. This paper argues that extraordinary rendition provides flexibility to policymakers to detain terrorists in cases where an attack may be forthcoming and when other approved legal processes are slow to react. Therefore, instead of ending extraordinary renditions altogether, the United States should reevaluate how it implements the policy on a tactical, operational, and strategic level and amend it based on the recommendations put forward in this article."}

The goals of this paper are to: 1. review factors that affect nighttime visibility, with an emphasis on driving, 2. provide the reader with online access to an automated modified Adrian/CIE visibility level (VL) calculator (VLC), and 3. suggest future research for enhancing the objective measurement of visibility. Recognizing that luminance contrast is the primary sensory determinant of nighttime visibility, several contrast-detection models have been proposed to quantify visibility in dim lighting. Of these, the Adrian (1989) model accounts for comparatively more of the important variables and has been the most widely accepted. The mathematical steps for calculating target VL in the modified Adrian/CIE model are presented and the VLC user interface is explained in step-by-step order. The VLC provides an easy-to-use tool for calculating target VL. Several additional factors that affect VL that are not currently included in the model provide important research opportunities for enhancing the measurement of target visibility in nighttime conditions. The VLC is an open-access application intended to foster the measurement of VL in professional practice and to foster research to advance the utility of the Adrian/CIE model."}

Based on toponymy records, historical materials, and fieldwork data, a database of settlements in the Zhangjiu River Basin in Yunnan Province has been established. This chapter reconstructs a temporal and spatial record of changes in the basin over the past 300 years. The results show that the increase of settlements in the Zhangjiu River Basin occurred in three stages: a slow-growth period from 1700 to 1800, a fast-growth stage from 1800 to 1950, and again a slow-growth period after 1950. Spatially, the middle and lower reaches of the river valley had greatest density of settlements, and the expansion of new settlements occurred in a pattern that generally exhibited movement from the downstream to the upstream and from lower to higher elevations. Settlements located at heights between 2,200 m and 2,500 m and gradients of 20 degrees or more represented important limiting factors for the expansion of settlements. Immigration and population expansion were the main driving forces that impelled settlement to expand in the river basin."}

In regions like Selangor, Malaysia, these issues strain resources and highlight the need for sustainable alternatives. While passive design strategies offer potential solutions, their effectiveness in such climates remains underexplored, limiting evidence-based design advancements for energy-efficient, comfortable living spaces. This study investigates the effectiveness of passive design strategies in enhancing indoor thermal comfort in naturally ventilated residential buildings in the hot and humid tropical climate of Selangor, Malaysia. Through a dual case study approach, the research evaluates the impact of passive design elements, including shading devices, building orientation, natural ventilation, and material selection, on operative temperature (Top) and overall thermal comfort. The primary goal is to assess these solutions' thermal effectiveness in mitigating heat and enhancing comfort levels in tropical residential settings. The second goal is to conduct a comparative of the thermal performance of two residential buildings, showing the practical benefits and limitations of different passive design approaches. The study's findings shed light on the most successful design components for establishing optimal thermal conditions, providing significant recommendations for architects and engineers seeking to create energy-efficient and comfortable living environments in tropical climates. This study highlights the differing impacts of passive design on indoor thermal comfort and energy efficiency in urban and rural settings, with urban residences benefiting more from integrated strategies. The findings emphasize the need for greater adoption of passive techniques in rural buildings to reduce reliance on mechanical systems and enhance sustainability. "}

The results indicate that the increasing concentrations of Hg in the sediments are influenced by natural factors and anthropogenic input simultaneously. Generally, about 2/3 of the Hg in the sediment was from anthropogenic sources. In the early 20th century, the anthropogenic input was owing to the urban development and fossil fuel consumptions surrounding the Taihu Lake and the worldwide atmospheric deposition of Hg since the industrial revolution. The concentration and anthropogenic fluxes of Hg increased with the industrial development in the catchment since the 1930s.

In the case (3), i.e. in brane and Kaluza Klein\nscenarios, the use of a metric independent measure makes it possible to\nconstruct naturally models where only the extra dimensions get curved and the\n4-D remain flat."}

We theoretically model and empirically estimate how macroeconomic and federal tax policy uncertainty separately affect the demand for tax credits using data from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. By exploiting reapplications, our identification strategy is simple: federal tax credit prices depend on changes in federal tax policy uncertainty while state tax credit prices do not. Consistent with the theoretical expectations we derive, investors view tax credits as an insurance vehicle causing tax credit prices to increase in response to higher levels of policy uncertainty. As expected, we also confirm that tax credit prices decrease in response to an increase in macroeconomic uncertainty. Our results shed light on the efficiency of using tax credits to finance low-income housing and other types of public infrastructure."}

Despite their proliferation, it is not fully understood why EU legislators choose between them. What explains EU legislators’ preference? Existing scholarship points at the need for effective engagement with regulated industries as one potential explanation. This chapter further explores that relationship: to what extent can regulated industry characteristics explain the choice for EU agencies or networks of national authorities? The chapter relies on a comparative analysis of four case studies in the areas of public health and aviation, which are based on 37 interviews and archival research. The chapter finds that the choice between institutional designs indeed relates to a regulated industry’s degree of concentration. This paper furthermore finds that the distinction between agencies and networks is not always clear-cut, and calls for a focus on the specific tasks they perform."}

As an educational tool and a shared research laboratory, participatory simulations such as the UVA Bay Game, provide distinctive opportunities for complex systems learning and for investigating the relation among complex systems thinking, data correlation, communication, decision-making, social behavior, and behavior change. Traditional simulation models are typically expressed in the form of equation-based models that relate a set of input parameters and assumptions through a collection of equations that produce system states and outputs. The quantification associated with complex adaptive system simulation provides additional rigor for adequate anthropological explanations of physical artifacts of social integration."}

In some of its earliest conceptualisations (see, for example, Niskanen 1991), soft infrastructure is viewed as the core institutional framework that underpins the operation of an economic, political and/or social system. Overtime, this conceptualisation has evolved to stress the role of soft infrastructure as an enabler of hard infrastructure (i.e. transport, energy and information), with the former setting the frameworks and rules for the latter’s establishment, evolution and usage. The salience of soft infrastructure to national infrastructure systems (NISs) has only increased as these systems have morphed into polycentric systems under a mix of state and non-state ownership, but also as shifts in the form and volume of flows within and across NIS has reshaped usage. Initially this chapter will examine the emergent themes between territoriality and links between the soft and hard infrastructure systems. Thereafter the chapter moves on to focus upon two main themes on the soft/hard infrastructure interface namely usage and provision-based issues. The salience of soft infrastructure to the NIS reflects that the ability of hard infrastructure to function to the needs of the state’s territorial strategy requires an enabling institutional system comprising a set of rules (both formal and informal) that seek to shape activity over – and development within – the NIS to ensure its adherence to the state’s territorial objectives (North 1994). These rules operate as constraints"}

We studied both female mate choice and male–male competition for mates among C. pecosensis, C. variegatus, and their F1 hybrids to determine what role these behaviours played in the formation of the hybrid swarm. Female C. pecosensis preferred male C. variegatus to conspecific males, C. variegatus females displayed no significant preference when given a choice between purebred males, and neither C. pecosensis nor C. variegatus females discriminated against F1 hybrid males. We found no evidence for female olfactory recognition of mates. Male F1 hybrids and C. variegatus were more aggressive than C. pecosensis males, achieving greater reproductive success under two different experimentally-induced mating systems. Hybrids were superior to C. variegatus when only two males competed (dominance interactions), but the two types were competitively equivalent in a territorial mating system. Our results indicate that active inter- and intra-sexual selection contributed to the accelerated hybridization between these two species. By including the possibility that some aspects of a hybridization and introgression event may be under positive selection, researchers may better understand the dynamics that lead to hybrid zone stability or the spread of introgressed genetic material."}

Diffusion-weighted datasets were merged with anatomic data for navigation purposes. The pyramidal tracts were segmented and reconstructed for three-dimensional visualization. The reconstruction results, together with the fused-image dataset, were available during surgery in the environment of a customized neuronavigation system.\nRESULTS \nIn all four patients, the combination of reconstructed data and fused images was a helpful additional source of information concerning the tumor seat and topographical interaction with the pyramidal tract. In two patients, intraoperative motor cortex stimulation verified the tumor seat with regard to the precentral gyrus.\nCONCLUSION \nDiffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows individual estimation of large fiber tracts applicable as important information in intraoperative neuronavigation and in planning brain tumor resection. A three-dimensional representation of fibers associated with the pyramidal tract during brain tumor surgery is feasible with the presented technique and is a helpful adjunct for the neurosurgeon. The main drawbacks include the length of time required for the segmentation procedure, the lack of direct intraoperative control of the pyramidal tract position, and brain shift. However, mapping of large fiber tracts and its intraoperative use for neuronavigation have the potential to increase the safety of neurosurgical procedures and to reduce surgical morbidity."}

Uganda is a prime example of states rising up to this challenge. Uganda ratified the ICC Statute in 2002. In 2008, it established the International Crimes Division (ICD) to prosecute international crimes and in 2010, it enacted the International Criminal Court Act to implement the ICC Statute. Even before these reforms, Uganda’s military courts had always relied on service offences to prosecute members of the national defence force. Worthy to note, members of the Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces (UPDF) have been implicated in a number of atrocities, some of which can be categorised as international crimes. However, military courts continue to prosecute UPDF soldiers for these atrocities on the basis of service offences. The situation current in Uganda highlights a number of legal issues relating to: first, the adequacy of service offences to advance accountability for the international crimes allegedly committed by UPDF soldiers; secondly, the jurisdiction of military courts over international crimes; and thirdly, the effect of concurrent jurisdiction by the ICD and military courts on the rule against double jeopardy."}

The degradation efficiency of 2-CP was improved from 60% to > 80% under LPS treatment. The biostimulant maintained the morphology of strain, reduced the level of reactive oxygen species , and recovered the cell membrane permeability from 39% to 22%. It also significantly increased the level of electron transfer activity and extracellular polymeric substances secretion and improved the metabolic activity of the strain. The transcriptome results revealed the stimulation of LPS to promote biological processes such as bacterial proliferation, metabolism, membrane structure composition, and energy conversion. This study provided new insights and references for the reuse of fermentation waste streams in biostimulation methods. • Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation waste solution (LPS) is used as biostimulant. • LPS improves the biodegradation efficiency of 2-CP. • LPS reduces oxidative stress levels to reduce stress injury. • LPS enhances metabolic activity and enhances EPS secretion. • LPS stimulates the expression of genes related to metabolism and degradability."}

It is, however, unclear how this factor is assessed in the dental practice routine. The aim of this study was to investigate what Brazilian dental implant specialists know and understand about BQ, if they include BQ assessments in their treatment planning and which methods they use to assess BQ. A questionnaire was posted to Brazilian dental implant specialists, containing open and closed questions about their knowledge and understanding of BQ assessment, and 221 answered the questionnaire. Data were gathered and methods for BQ assessment were grouped using hierarchical cluster analysis. Answers about BQ knowledge and understanding were categorized into quantity of cortical and marrow bone (n = 72), density (n = 55), type of bone (n = 35), bone height (n = 30), bone thickness (n = 27), primary stability (n = 24) and other less common categories. BQ assessment was judged relevant to be considered a selection criterion for implant treatment. Overall frequency analysis showed that methods were roughly divided into usual (n > 170) and unusual methods (n < 9). Cluster analysis grouped BQ assessment methods into four clusters: unusual methods (DEXA, resonance frequency, Periotest and occlusal radiography), perioperative methods (peak insertion torque and tactile perception), sectional imaging (computed tomography) and plain films (periapical and panoramic radiographs). No consensus on BQ understanding or the clinical application of methods to assess BQ was found in this survey. The selection of methods shows a clear natural grouping from basic to advanced strategies for BQ assessment by Brazilian specialists in dental implants."}

Plants can take up nitrate, ammonium, urea, and other organic N forms. Various transporters for these compounds have been characterized, and the localization and properties of these proteins give rise to a complex pattern of N fluxes within the plant. The further assimilation of nitrate is well described, but the in planta role of all proteins, as for example GS1 and GDH, is far from being evident. Some are involved in N remobilization which is an important N source for example during seed filling. Regulation of N assimilation occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, and regulation of the different steps is highly coordinated. However, only very few molecular players are known. As a special case in N-signaling, NO, a side product of N assimilation, is considered in some detail."}

The results show that the whistler-mode turbulence (0.1fce ≤ f ≤ 0.75fce) can accelerate substorm injection electrons with several hundreds of keV through wave-particle gyroresonant interaction and hence may play an important role in the electron acceleration during substorms. The compressional ULF turbulence (2–15 mHz) can accelerate both lower-energy background electrons (<30 keV) and substorm injection electrons (∼30–300 keV) through the transit-time damping mechanism. So the compressional ULF turbulence acceleration mechanism is important during both substorms and quiet times. The compressional ULF turbulence accelerates substorm injection electrons more effectively than whistler-mode turbulence. The combined electron acceleration by whistler-mode and ULF turbulences is most effective and can cause the number density of the relativistic electrons increase largely within about 8 hours. Substorms can offer both substorm injection electrons and strong turbulences, and therefore large flux enhancement events of relativistic electrons (≥1 MeV) always occur during substorm time. For magnetic storms that are composed of a series of substorms, extremely large flux enhancement events of the relativistic electrons can thus occur."}

Contrary to what I claimed in A philosophy of boredom (2005), there is a good reason to assume that boredom exists also outside of the human species. However, relatively little research has been done on animal boredomAnimal boredom, and animals are virtually absent in boredom studies. The first part of the chapter will discuss how we can justify the ascription of various mental and emotional states to nonlinguistic creatures. I here draw on my book Understanding animals (2019), arguing that such states are not hidden from view in some ‘inner’ realm, but are for the most part in plain view. This is especially clear in the case of such phenomena as fearFear, where the criteria for establishing that an animal experiences fear are quite straightforward. More complex emotions like grief, lonelinessLoneliness, and boredom will have more complex criteria, and you need information about the context in which the emotional expression occurs. The criteria will further differ somewhat from species to species (e.g., cats and dogs who wag their tail). Nevertheless, I will argue that we can plausibly argue that boredom occurs in many other species than humans and that this is especially clear in the case of mammals, birds, and at least some species of octopus. Using the term ‘boredom’ to describe the emotional state of these animals will invite charges of anthropomorphismAnthropomorphism, but I will argue that it is legitimate use of anthropomorphism. The acknowledgment of boredom as an emotion to be found also in nonhuman animals creates problems for theories of boredom that place the concept of meaning (existentialExistential meaning, not semantic meaning) at the center of their account, and argue that boredom consists of a lack of meaningLack of meaning. My book, A philosophy of boredom (2005), is an example of such an approach. The main problem is that such meaning seems to presuppose languageLanguage. I will argue that we have reason to believe that no nonhuman animals have a capacity for proper language—and that includes even the most meticulously trained primates—and therefore one must give an account of animal boredom that does not employ the concept of meaning. When we analyze the concept of meaning, we find that the notion of caring is useful. And it is no stretch to say that many nonhuman animals have a capacity for caring for various objects and activities, but what they care about will to a great extent vary from species to species. We can then define animal boredom in terms of being deprived of objects and activities for which they care."}

Disappearance of the longest-lived o-Ps component with τ5 present in the PAL spectrum of initial MCM-41 mesoporous material in the PAL spectra of MnFe2O4-impregnated MCM-41 measured in vacuum is a result of either a strong chemical o-Ps quenching or the Ps inhibition effects. The intensity I4 of the medium-lived component initially increases, reaching a maximum value for the sample with minimum manganese ferrite content, and then decreases monotonically. Analogous dependence for the intensity I3 of the shortest-lived component shows a maximum at higher MnFe2O4 content. Filling of open pores present in the studied nanocomposites by N2 or O2 at ambient pressure causes partial reappearance of the τ4 and τ5 components, except a sample with maximum ferrite content. The lifetimes of these components measured in O2 are shortened in comparison to that observed in N2 because of paramagnetic quenching.

MOG-PUF was used for the adsorption of malachite green (MG) dye from its aqueous solution and also tested for antibacterial activity. Synthesis of MOG-PUF and malachite green-loaded MOG-PUF (MG-loaded MOG-PUF) were successfully characterized using various analytical techniques. Batch experiment studies revealed almost 100% removal of MG using MOG-PUF within 30 min.

However, there is a continuing debate about the ability of epidemiology not only to describe, but also to provide results which can be better translated into public health practice. It has been proposed that participatory research approaches be applied to epidemiology as a way to bridge this gap between description and action. A systematic account of what constitutes participatory epidemiology practice has, however, been lacking. A scoping review was carried out focused on the question of what constitutes participatory approaches to epidemiology for the purpose of demonstrating their potential for advancing epidemiologic research. Relevant databases were searched, including both the published and non-published (grey) literature. The 102 identified sources were analyzed in terms of comparing common epidemiologic approaches to participatory counterparts regarding central aspects of the research process. Exemplary studies applying participatory approaches were examined more closely. A highly diverse, interdisciplinary body of literature was synthesized, resulting in a framework comprised of seven aspects of the research process: research goal, research question, population, context, data synthesis, research management, and dissemination of findings. The framework specifies how participatory approaches not only differ from, but also how they can enhance common approaches in epidemiology. Finally, recommendations for the further development of participatory approaches are given. These include: enhancing data collection, data analysis, and data validation; advancing capacity building for research at the local level; and developing data synthesis. The proposed framework provides a basis for systematically developing the emergent science of participatory epidemiology."}

Every project is unique, as all organisms are different and variety of different data types and tools exist.

Experience in genome assembly and annotation exists in Europe but it varies between the ELIXIR Nodes, with some already having built up stable infrastructures and others just starting out.

This study suggests two potential psychological pathways linking physical activity and social media dependence in adolescence, with depression potentially serving as a mediating factor and difficulty describing feelings acting as a moderating factor. A self-reported survey was conducted with 3,247 Chinese adolescents, including measures of physical activity, social media dependence, depression, and difficulty describing feelings. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were performed on these variables, and a mediation-moderation model was developed. Physical activity showed a significant negative correlation with social media dependence, depression, and difficulty describing feelings. Additionally, depression was positively correlated with both social media dependence and difficulty describing feelings, and difficulty describing feelings was positively correlated with social media dependence. Furthermore, difficulty describing feelings moderated the relationship between depression and social media dependence in adolescence. This study provides further insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical activity and social media dependence in adolescence. Depression serves as a mediating factor, while difficulty describing feelings acts as a moderating factor in the relationship between depression and social media dependence. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of depression and difficulty describing feelings in the relationship between physical activity and social media dependence, offering valuable implications for more comprehensive and targeted interventions aimed at reducing social media dependence among adolescents."}

It is shown that the difference in absorption line parameters in the spectroscopic databases leads to an error less than 0.7 W/m2 (0.3%) in the simulated integral fluxes in the 0–3000 cm−1 region, at that the relative differences in the spectral fluxes calculated with moderate spectral resolution (20 cm−1) are up to 10%.

In the middle of the century, as the international situation grew increasingly tense, political journalism gradually gave way to the first scholarly studies of foreign policy. A further step that gave impetus to historians' work on the subject was the work of the jurist G.W.

The prime objective of this project task is to select a natural gas-fired ATS (Advanced Turbine System) that could be manufactured and marketed should development costs not be at issue with the goals of: (1) Coal of electricity 10% below 1991 vintage power plants in same market class and size. (2) Expected performance 60% efficiency and higher, (3) Emission levels, NO{sub x} < 10 ppM (0.15 lb/MW-h), CO < 20 ppM (0.30 lb/MW-h), and UHC < 20 ppM (0.30 lb/MW-h). ABB screening studies have identified the gas-fueled combined cycle as the most promising full scale solution to achieve the set goals for 1988--2002. This conclusion is based on ABB`s experience level, as well as the multi-step potential of the combined cycle process to improve in many component without introducing radical changes that might increase costs and lower RAM. The technical approach to achieve 60% or better thermal efficiency will include increased turbine inlet temperatures, compressor intercooling, as well a improvements in material, turbine cooling technology and the steam turbine.

Two-dimensional atomic crystals are a versatile playground to study the influence of strain, as they can sustain very large deformations without breaking. Various optical techniques have been employed to probe strain in two-dimensional materials, including micro-Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Here we demonstrate that optical second harmonic generation constitutes an even more powerful technique, as it allows extraction of the full strain tensor with a spatial resolution below the optical diffraction limit. Our method is based on the strain-induced modification of the nonlinear susceptibility tensor due to a photoelastic effect. Using a two-point bending technique, we determine the photoelastic tensor elements of molybdenum disulfide. Once identified, these parameters allow us to spatially image the two-dimensional strain field in an inhomogeneously strained sample. Strain is an effective tool to tune the optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional materials. Here, the authors demonstrate that second harmonic generation can be used to extract the full strain tensor of MoS2 and to spatially image its two-dimensional strain field."}

The use of the crystal, however, has been hampered by the unavailability of antireflective (AR) coatings with high laser damage resistance. In this work, a “point contact” dip-coating method is developed to prepare sol–gel SiO2 AR coatings on small-size LBO crystals. Using this approach, we obtain a homogenous coating surface on an 8 mm×8 mm×3 mm LBO crystal. The stress measurements show that the stresses in sol–gel SiO2 coatings vary with the time of natural drying, which is beyond our expectation. The anisotropic Young’s modulus of the LBO crystal and the different evolution tendency of the stress in the different SiO2 coating layers are found to be responsible for the crack of the double-layer AR coatings on anisotropic LBO crystal. Meanwhile, the resulting coatings on LBO crystal achieve a LIDT of over 15 J/cm2 (532 nm, 3ns) and the coated LBO is expected to have a transmittance of over 99% at 800 nm."}

Therefore, much attention is paid to improving the efficiency of the last stages of gas turbines as well as the distribution of flow parameters. Since the long blades of the last stages of multistage high-power gas turbines could fall into the resonance frequency range in the course of operation, which results in the destruction of the blades, damping wires or damping bolts are used for turning out of resonance frequencies. However, these damping elements cause additional energy losses leading to a reduction in the efficiency of the stage. To minimize these losses, dampening shrouds are used instead of wires and bolts at the periphery of the working blades. However, because of the strength problems, designers have to use, instead of the most efficient full shrouds, partial shrouds that do not provide for significantly reducing the losses in the tip clearance between the blade and the turbine housing. In this paper, a computational study is performed concerning an effect that the design of the shroud of the turbine-working blade exerted on the flow structure in the vicinity of the shroud and on the efficiency of the stage as a whole. The analysis of the flow structure has shown that a significant part of the losses under using the shrouds is associated with the formation of vortex zones in the cavities on the turbine housing before the shrouds, between the ribs of the shrouds, and in the cavities at the outlet behind the shrouds. All the investigated variants of a partial shrouding are inferior in efficiency to the stages with shrouds that completely cover the tip section of the working blade. The stage with a unshrouded working blade was most efficient at the values of the relative tip clearance less than 0.9%."}

Eine Identifikation der genetischen Ursache einer Erkrankung ist jedoch essenziell, um zusätzliche invasive Tests vermeiden, adäquate Therapiemaßnahmen in die Wege leiten, akkurate Prognosen stellen und eine entsprechende genetische Beratung anbieten zu können. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-basierte Techniken wie die Whole Exome Sequenzierung (WES) haben die humangenetische Forschung und Diagnostik in den letzten Jahren revolutioniert. Die WES ermöglicht die Sequenzierung der Exons aller proteincodierenden Gene von mehreren Individuen gleichzeitig und stellt ein hilfreiches Werkzeug bei der Suche nach neuen kranheitsrelevanten Genen im Menschen dar.\r\nDie vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Aufklärung genetischer Ursachen verschiedenster Erkrankungen in konsanguinen Familien aus dem nahen und mittleren Osten mittels WES. Insgesamt wurden 43 Patienten mit unterschiedlichen Krankheitsbildern untersucht, darunter viele mit Skelettdysplasien oder Neuropathien. In 22 Fällen (51%) konnte die entsprechende krankheitsverursachende Mutation ausfindig gemacht werden. In 21% der aufgeklärten Fälle wurden Sequenzvarianten detektiert, die in der Literatur bereits als pathogen beschrieben wurden, während 63% bisher noch unbekannte Mutationen in bereits als krankheitsrelevant beschriebenen Genen darstellten. Zudem konnten im Rahmen dieser Arbeit drei neue, für den Menschen krankheitsrelevante Gene identifiziert werden, solute carrier family 10 member 7 (SLC10A7), T-box 4 (TBX4) und MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 3 (MIA3). SLC10A7 codiert für einen Transporter aus der Familie der solute carrier, der in der Plasmamembran verankert ist. In dieser Arbeit geleistete Analyseergebnisse konnten zu der Erstbeschreibung von homozygoten pathogenen SLC10A7-Mutationen als Ursache für eine Skelettdysplasie mit Amelogenesis imperfecta beitragen. Bei TBX4 handelt es sich um einen hochkonservierten Transkriptionsfaktor, der während der embryonalen Entwicklung an der Ausbildung der unteren Extremitäten beteiligt ist. Homozygote pathogene TBX4-Mutationen wurden im Kontext dieser Arbeit erstmalig mit einer posterioren Amelie mit Becken- und Lungenhypoplasie in Verbindung gebracht. MIA3 ist ein Transmembranprotein des endoplasmatischen Retikulums, das eine essenzielle Rolle bei der Proteinsekretion spielt. Die hier vorgestellten Patienten mit homozygoten pathogenen MIA3-Mutationen zeigen eine komplexe syndromale Erkrankung, die sich hauptsächlich in einer Kollagenopathie, Diabetes mellitus und milder mentaler Retardierung manifestiert und ein neues Krankheitsbild darstellt.\r\n\tDie im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erzielten Ergebnisse erweitern somit zum einen das Mutationsspektrum verschiedener bekannter Krankheitsbilder und offenbaren zum anderen neue krankheitsrelevante Gene im Menschen."}

The time dependence of yields, average molecular weights, molecular-weight distributions and changes in hydroxyl-group content and elemental composition were determined. Deuterium FT n.m.r. was used to monitor the incorporation of deuterium from 1,1-dideuteriotetralin into aliphatic and aromatic structures in the fractionated products. The exchange of 2H with phenol in the presence of the coal was examined to aid in the interpretation of 2H n.m.r. results. 13C and 1H FT n.m.r. and i.r. spectroscopy were used to monitor the fractionated products over time. The ultimate obtainable yields of THF-soluble product were not significantly altered by the shorter temperature-rise times. The highoxygen-containing subbituminous coal undergoes an extremely rapid loss of about 20% of its oxygen by dehydration, and was found to enhance the rate of reduction of acetophenone and the scrambling of deuterium label in tetralin. The growth of benzylic aliphatic hydrogen at the expense of β (ArCH2CH2) hydrogen was rapid in the early stages of reaction. In spite of apparently labile aliphatic structures, the preasphaltenes exhibited products above MW 1200 that were stable for more than 2 h at 500 °C."}

Target product profiles (TPPs) guide medical product development by defining desired characteristics to address specific diseases or needs. By specifying safety, efficacy, usability, access, and differentiation, TPPs help to prioritize resources, surface challenges early, and reduce failure risk. Although common in drug development, TPPs are less often applied to substance use disorders (SUDs). This article shows how an SUD TPP should balance regulatory feasibility, clinical relevance, and commercial viability. We offer an example TPP for an aspirational opioid use disorder drug to test differentiation and market assumptions against existing therapies.

Current PFAS source-allocation methods often demand data on many compounds while overlooking differences in matrix type nature, leading to high costs and potential errors. In this study, matrix-specific machine-learning classifiers were developed to discriminate PFAS originating from aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) versus non-AFFF sources in soil and water. A comprehensive dataset was compiled from peer-reviewed literature (2012-2024), comprising 673 soil samples (437 AFFF-impacted, 263 non-AFFF), 520 water samples (379 AFFF-impacted, 141 non-AFFF), and 111 original AFFF formulations. Log-transformed concentrations of 12 legacy PFAS compounds were analyzed using fifteen classification algorithms through H2O.AutoML platform. The optimal water model (Gradient Boosting Machine) achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9864, accuracy of 0.8929, sensitivity of 0.9286, and specificity of 0.8571. The optimal soil model (Distributed Random Forest) achieved an AUC of 0.9936, accuracy of 0.9787, sensitivity of 0.9787, and specificity of 0.9787. Feature-importance analysis revealed PFOS, PFHxS, and PFPeS as the strongest water indicators, and PFHxS, PFPeA, and PFOS in soil. Stepwise variable reduction showed that source allocation accuracy above 0.92 can be maintained using only nine PFAS indicators in water and six in soil, significantly reducing the data requirements. This matrix-specific approach recognizes how PFAS compounds behave differently across environmental media, while identifying key “sentinel” indicators reduces analytical burden without sacrificing classification performance. This targeted methodology enhances forensic source tracking capabilities while providing more efficient guidance for remediation efforts. "}

Democratic citizenship can also be understood as a civility, which means respecting the individual's individuality, value and freedom, but at the same time pursuing common good based on healthy relationships with others in the community. It is true that despite the need for modern Christianity to practice this civility more gracefully and politely in the public sphere, some churches and Christians have failed to show it during the Corona crisis. Under these circumstances, this study made the following suggestions for the realization of communality through the practice of democratic citizenship beyond the privatization of modern Christianity. First, Christianity needs recognition as a public church and theological establishment of it. Second, modern Christianity needs to recognize the importance of a network society and practice public good more than ever. Third, modern Christianity should be able to provide a new lifestyle for the development of public character in the community. So the New Normal-era church should be able to restore its original churchlikeness by having a Christian identity and communicating gentlemanly in the public domain."}

Due to incipient resistance in P. falciparum to chloroquine, the dose of the drug has to be increased. Diagnosis of the species of parasite is thus important. In chloroquine resistant P. falciparum cases, long acting sulfonamide with pyrimethamine is at present capable of terminating acute P. falciparum infection. In cerebral malaria, where the susceptibility status of the parasite is not known, intravenous quinine is indicated. In situations where the transmission of malaria remains un-interrupted, suppressive chloroquine is not advocated. Personal prophylaxis is indicated. Caution is to be excercised in the use of primaquine which is a relatively toxic drug for the treatment of relapse of P. vivax cases where transmission of malaria remains uninterrupted. The random use of combination of long acting sulfonamide and pyrimethamine is discouraged."}

During starvation small amounts of intracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase and β-glucosidase activities were also detected. Very low levels of -glucanase activity remained bound to mycelium and some activity was found loosely attached to the cells and/or to water-soluble 1,3-β-1,6-β-glucan adhering to the cell walls. During active growth intracellular 1,3-β-glucanase and mycelium-bound 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were detected in small or trace amounts. During hyphal growth very low levels of 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were also found to be weakly associated with the cells and/or with water-soluble -glucan covering the hyphae. Cycloheximide inhibited the increase in intra- and extracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase and -glucosidase activities. This indicated that de novo protein synthesis was involved in the intra- and extracellular appearance of these three enzyme activities in derepressed cells. The formation of the extracellular 1,3-β-glucanase, 1,6-β-glucanase and -glucosidase activities was regulated by catabolite repression. 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were uncompetitively inhibited and -glucosidase activity noncompetitively inhibited by glucose and glucono-δ-lactone. Optimum pH and temperature values as well as thermal stabilities of the three extracellular enzyme activities were determined. Almost all of the -glucosidase activity but only one-third of the extracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were found to bind to Con A-Sepharose. Under conditions of carbon limitation almost 90% of the extracellular 1,3-β-/1,6-β-glucan excreted during fungal growth was degraded by the extracellular -glucanases."}

The goal was to evaluate MS treatment compliance among patients enrolled in insurance plans with various cost-sharing arrangements for disease modifying therapies (DMT).\nThomson Reuters MarketScan® Commercial and Medicare databases (January 1, 2004-December 31, 2009) were used to identify adult patients with MS (ICD-9-CM: 340) and on DMT (claim for first DMT was the index event). Patients were assigned to three mutually exclusive cohorts based on DMT insurance plan cost-sharing levels: $0-, low- and high-cost-sharing. Median cost-sharing for DMTs, standardized to 2010 US dollars, was used to determine threshold between ‘low' and ‘high'. Medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence (time to discontinuation of DMT) were evaluated during 12-months following index.\nA total of 14,718 patients were identified and had cost-sharing arrangements as follows: $0 cost-sharing (n=1,361, 9.2%), low cost-sharing (n=6,044, 41.1%) and high cost-sharing (n=7,313, 49.7%). Majority were female (77%) and mean age was 46.1 years. Patients in $0 cost-sharing plans had significantly higher MPR values (0.83) than patients in both the low cost-sharing (0.81; p=0.037) and high cost-sharing plans (0.79; p<0.001). Discontinuation rates were also lower among patients in $0 cost-sharing plans (34.1%) versus patients with any cost-sharing (35.5% for low and 37.2% for high cost-sharing; p<0.001).\nPatients in plans with no cost-sharing have greater adherence and are less likely to discontinue treatment in the 12-month period following DMT initiation. These results suggest that patients with MS are sensitive to the financial costs associated with DMT and may make treatment decisions based on this burden. Manufacturer co-pay assistance programs designed to reduce patient financial burden were not considered in this analysis. Therefore, these results may underestimate the effects of benefit design on medication adherence and persistence."}

These simulations were based on helical diffraction theory applied to simplified atomic helical models, followed by Cerius2 calculations based on their complete molecular helical structures. Hundreds of samples were screened until a library containing 14 supramolecular dendrimers and dendronized polymers provided a sufficient number of helical features in the X-ray diffraction pattern of their oriented fibers. This combination of techniques provided examples of single-92 and -113 helices, triple-61, -81, -91, and -121 helices, and an octa-321 helix that were assembled from crownlike dendrimers, hollow and nonhollow supramolecular crownlike dendrimers, hollow and nonhollow supramolecular disklike dendrimers, and hollow and nonhollow supramolecular and macromolecular helicene-like architectures. The method elaborated here for the determination of the molecular helix structure was transplanted from the field of structural biology and will be applicable to other classes of synthetic helical assemblies. The determination of the molecular structure of helical supramolecular assemblies is expected to provide an additional level of precision in the design of helical functional assemblies resembling those from biological systems."}

A possible solution may lie with novel nonmotorized treadmill (NMT) devices as the belt surface is propelled by the user. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare gait performance during both MT and NMT locomotion to OG. Design: Crossover study. Setting: A university research laboratory. Patients: A total of 20 healthy adults (10 women) participated in the study. Intervention: Each participant performed self-selected walking and running OG, and on both an MT and NMT. Main Outcome Measure: Shoulder, trunk, and lower-extremity kinematics were analyzed for each treadmill condition and compared to OG. Results: The analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between MT and OG gait kinematics during either walking or running. However, NMT gait showed increased hip, knee, and ankle flexions in late swing and early stance compared to OG during both walking and running. For example, during walking, the NMT elicited hip-, knee-, and ankle-flexion/extension angles of 34.7°, 8.0°, and 3.6° at foot strike compared to 24.8°, −3.1°, and −5.8° in the OG condition (P < .05). There was also a significant reduction in trunk-flexion/extension range of motion during running compared to OG (7.7° in NMT vs 9.8° in OG). Conclusions: These differences may have implications for both training and rehabilitation on an NMT. Future studies should consider the influence of NMT familiarization on gait performance and should emphasize the assessment of neuromuscular performance."}

However, the specific interrelationships among these variables in explaining the occurrence of depression remain unclear. Drawing upon susceptibility theory and cognitive-behavioral theory, this study explored whether personality traits influences adolescent depression through loneliness and PIU. A total of 2476 adolescents (aged 12–18) from all over the country completed a psycho-social test, including the 10-Item Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-10), three-Item Loneliness Scale (T-ILS), Problematic Internet Use Questionnaire-Short Form (PIUQ-SF-6) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The mediation model was built and bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effect. Results showed that neuroticism, conscientiousness, openness, and agreeableness have a direct role on depression. Loneliness and PIU partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and depression, and completely mediated the relationship between extroversion and depression. The results suggest that loneliness and PIU play important mediating roles in the relationship between personality traits and depression. This remind us that alleviating sense of loneliness and reducing overuse of the internet are a strategy for improve depression among adolescents."}

In the present investigation we describe the antioxidant potential of these plants and the therapeutic potential of dietary compounds as possible anti-glycation and antioxidant agents. This study was geared to appraise the total antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of ten common culinary herbs and spices (Allium sativum, Zingiber officinale, Thymus vulgaris, Petroselinum crispum, Murraya koenigii Spreng, Mentha piperita L., Curcuma longa L., Allium cepa L., Allium fistulosum and Coriandrum sativum L.) commercially available on the Mauritian market. The total antioxidant capacity as measured by the phosphomolybdenum method ranged from 0.76 to 2.49 μg AAE/ml. It was observed that the ethanolic extracts exhibited significant (p < 0.05) free radical-scavenging potential as measured by the 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radical cation assay, ferrous ion chelating assay and the Griess assay. The observed anti-glycation and antioxidant activity of the extracts together with their previously reported total phenolic, flavonoid and tannin contents support the therapeutic value of the plants investigated. Dietary agents interfering in the glycation pathway might offer new lead compounds geared towards glucose-derived and oxidative stress related complications. Our findings showed that the herbs and spices studied possess significant antioxidant and anti-glycation properties and hence can be exploited as functional foods."}

Consequently, the mass matrix can be lumped (via row-sum lumping) without compromising spatial accuracy in explicit dynamics calculations. We also address the imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions and the preservation of approximate bi-orthogonality under geometric mappings. In addition, we establish a link between the exact dual and approximate dual basis functions via an iterative algorithm that improves the approximate dual basis towards exact bi-orthogonality.

Minimal research has focused on the impact of mistreatment experiences during childbirth on adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes. To determine whether there is an association between mistreatment of women during facility-based childbirth and postpartum depression occurrence. We used data from the 2015 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort Study. Women who had given birth in a local medical hospital facility (either public or private) under the supervision of a skilled birth attendant in the year 2015 were considered eligible to take part in the study, as well as their newborns (cohort members). Self-report mistreatment experiences during childbirth (disrespect and abuse) and postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed by household interviews three months after delivery. Mistreatment included information on physical abuse, verbal abuse, denial of care, and undesired procedures. Binary variables were created to indicate the occurrence of at least one, and at least two mistreatment experiences. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale to assess postpartum depression. A positive screening was defined as EPDS ≥ 15. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the odds of having a positive screening for postpartum depression between women who experienced mistreatment during childbirth and those who did not. We adjusted for potential confounders including family income, maternal education, age, skin color, parity, marital status, desire for pregnancy, fathers’ reaction when discovering the pregnancy, previous depression, pregnancy morbidities, and deliver type (C-section or vaginal). We tested for interaction between antenatal depression (EPDS ≥ 10) and mistreatment experiences on the occurrence of postpartum depression. A total of 4275 cohort members took part in the perinatal follow-up. The three-month follow-up interviewed 4087 biological mothers; 18.3% and 5.1% reported having experienced at least one and at least two types of mistreatment forms during childbirth, respectively; 6.8% screened positive for postpartum depression (EPDS ≥ 15). Women reported having experienced at least one type of mistreatment presented higher odds for postpartum depression (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.07–2.20) as well as the women who reported at least two mistreatment forms (OR: 1.85; 95% CI: 1.06–3.24). We observed an interaction between antenatal depression and mistreatment during childbirth on postpartum depression. We found higher odds of postpartum depression among women who did not experienced antenatal depression (OR: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.05–5.14) when compared those who did (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.81–1.90) for at least one mistreatment experience. The odds of postpartum depression among women reporting both antenatal depression and mistreatment during childbirth was 15.5 (95% CI: 9.6–25.0). Mistreatment during childbirth higher the odds of postpartum depression three months after birth. The independent effect of having experienced mistreatment during childbirth on postpartum depression is greater for women not presenting depression during pregnancy. Strategies to promote high-quality and respectful maternal healthcare are essential to prevent mother–child adverse outcomes. Women presenting antenatal depression are a priority group for interventions."}

Though the usage of geothermal energy piles has rapidly increased in the past three decades, there is so far limited understanding of their thermo-mechanical performance, and its application is earlier than theoretical investigation. Based on four published research findings, the bearing capacity and the mobilized shaft resistance of pile under thermal loading are analyzed. When geothermal energy pile (GEP) is heated, its bearing capacity will be increased, and the friction resistance of the upper section will be decreased. At the same time, friction resistance of the lower section is increased, and the axial force along pile will be enlarged. Whilst geothermal energy pile is cooled, friction resistance of the upper section will be increased, and that of the low pile is decreased. The mobilized strain, stress and shaft resistance profile are related to the constraint condition of pile ends. There is even tensile stress in pile under the special case with cooling load, which is adverse to its bearing capacity. The results is reference to design geothermal energy pile under similar circumstance."}

Werden diese durch einfache Einkapselung von Indikatoren hergestellt, so wird die Stabilität der Schicht bedingt durch das Auswaschen des Farbstoffes auf etwa einen Tag begrenzt. Zur Unterdrückung dieses Farbstoffaustrages wurde eine neue Immobilisierungsmethode entwickelt und erprobt, die in der kovalenten Anbindung von Fluoreszenzindikatoren an das wasserlösliche Polysaccharid Dextran (70.000 g/mol) und der anschließenden Einkapselung der makromolekular gebundenen Indikatormoleküle in hydrophilen Matrices besteht. Als Matrices wurden anorganische Silikagele, die nach dem Sol-Gel-Verfahren hergestellt wurden, und das organische Hydrogel Polyhydroxyethylmethacrylat (PolyHEMA) eingesetzt. Die vorgestellte Immobilisierungsmethode weist gegenüber der direkten kovalenten Anbindung des Indikators an die Matrix eine deutlich erhöhte Flexibilität auf, was beispielhaft an drei Analyt-Rezeptor-Paaren dargestellt wird.\r\nZur Herstellung von Quecksilber-sensitiven Schichten wurden zunächst Porphyrin-Dextrane synthetisiert und mittels spektroskopischer Methoden sowie durch Elektrophorese charakterisiert. Porphyrin-Dextran-dotierte, mesoporöse Silikagel- Schichten zeigten nach 40tägiger Lagerung in Meßpuffer noch 92% der anfänglichen Fluoreszenzintensität.\r\nAuf der Basis von Fluorescein-Dextran wurden pH-sensitive Silikagel- und PolyHEMA-Schichten hergestellt. Letztere zeigten einen Meßbereich von pH 5 bis 8 und Ansprechzeiten von 5 Sekunden/pH. Nach 18tägiger Lagerung in Meßpuffer zeigten die Sensoren noch über 95% der ursprünglichen Fluoreszenzintensitäten.\r\nDurch Coimmobilisierung von Calcium Green-Dextran und Texas Red-Dextran wurde ein Calcium-sensitiver Sensor mit interner Referenz hergestellt. Der Meßbereich des Sensors liegt zwischen 5  10-8 und 10-5 mol/l Ca(II) bei Ansprechzeiten von 5 Sekunden bis zum Erreichen des Sättigungswertes. Der Sensor erwies sich als sehr selektiv gegenüber Interferenzen von Na(I), K(I) und Mg(II). Durch die interne Referenzierung des Meßsignals läßt sich die Reproduzierbarkeit der Sensorsignale entscheidend verbessern.\r\nAls zweiter Schwerpunkt der Arbeit wurde in mehreren Schritten die Miniaturisierung der Calciumsensoren mit interner Referenz vorgenommen. Unter Verwendung von optischer Fasertechnik wurden Mikrosensoren mit Durchmessern von 600 bzw. 50 µm entwickelt. Basierend auf verjüngten Faserspitzen (Taper) mit Durchmessern von etwa 300 nm wurden die derzeit kleinsten faseroptischen Calciumsensoren (Nanosensoren) erhalten.\r\nAufgrund der verbesserten Stabilität und der extremen Miniaturisierung der vorgestellten optischen Sensoren lassen sich in Zukunft neue analytische Aufgabenstellungen (z.B. Messung in biologischen Zellen) mit einer Ortsauflösung im Nanometerbereich bearbeiten."}

Endeavors for dyes detection, removal, recycling and degradation are of great significances. However, existing methods for dyes detection are highly relied on instrumental tools. High instrumentation cost and poor portability prevent them being used for on-site rapid detection. For separation, recycling and degradation of dyes, well-designed materials featured with fine-tunable pore size, good permeability and large specific surface area are often indispensable. Robust and user-friendly multi-function platforms are highly practical but still rather limited. An all-in-one platform for fast visualization, removal, recycle and degradation of anionic dyes was developed using hydrophobic magnetic deep eutectic solvents (HMDESs) as an all-rounder. Anionic dyes could be efficiently extracted by HMDESs through electrostatic interaction and hydrophobic effect, giving extraction rates over 99.0% within 3 min. Colorimetric assays were adopted for fast visualization of dyes, of which the colorimetric LODs reached 10 -7 g/mL level. The extracted dyes could be facilely desorbed and recycled via adjusting system pH, showing recycling rates surpassed 99.5%. By combining with H 2 O 2 , Fenton reactions constructed by Fe 3+ -doped HMDES achieved nearly complete degradation of the extracted dyes. As proof-of-concept assays, the multi functions of HMDESs were experimentally proved using commercial drinks and simulated dye effluents (viz., dyes-spiked purified water, tap water, river water, aquaculture pond water and industrial sewage) as real samples, and the results were double-verified with instrumental tools and smartphone-derived digital image analysis. A HMDESs-based multi-purpose platform has been constructed herein, and its applications for fast visualization, removal, recycle and degradation of anionic dyes in both food and environmental samples have also been demonstrated. As far as we know, this is the first case to report such an all-in-one platform constructed by HMDESs for multi-dimension analysis of dyes. Since HMDESs are of many merits such as fine transplantability, easy-to-prepare, low cost, handy magnetic separation, etc., this work will find its more potentials in other areas like environmental analysis and biochemical separation and offer a reference for design other platforms for multi-use applications. • An all-in-one platform has been developed for multi-purpose analysis of anionic dyes • HMDES showed a removal rate over 99.0% for dyes within 3 min of adsorption time • Anionic dyes could be recycled by HMDESs with a recycling rate exceeded 99.5% • Dyes could be degraded over 96.1% within 1 min based on Fe-HMDES/H 2 O 2 Fenton system • HMDESs were ideal candidate to design novel strategy for multi-use applications"}

Messages transmitted through a noisy channel are susceptible to modification in their content, due to the action of the noise of the channel. Claude E. Shannon, in his seminal paper of 1948 &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;,\nintroduces the bit as a unit of measure of information, and he lays down the theoretical foundations needed to understand the problem of sending bits reliably through a noisy channel. The distortion measure, which he used to quantify reliability, is the error probability. In his paper, Shannon shows that any channel is characterized by a number that he calls capacity: It represents the highest transmission rate that\ncan be used to communicate information with, through this same channel, while guaranteeing a negligible error probability. Whereas, even if the messages are sent through a perfect channel, the time\nthey take to reach their destination causes the receiver to acquire a distorted view of the status of the source that generated these messages. For instance, take the case of a monitor interested in the status of a distant process. A sender observes this process and, to keep the monitor up-to-date, sends updates to it. However, if, at any time t, the last received update at the monitor was generated at time u(t),\nthen the information at the receiver reflects the status of the process at time u(t), not at time t. Hence, the monitor has a distorted version of reality. In fact, it has an obsolete version with an age of t-u(t). The concept of age as a distortion measure in communication systems was first used in 2011 by Kaul et al., in order to assess the performance of a given vehicular network. The aim of the authors was to come up with a transmission scheme that would minimize an age-related metric: the average age. Since then, a growing body of works has used this metric to evaluate the performance of multiple communication\nsystems. The drive behind this interest lies in the importance that status-update applications are gaining in today's life (in vehicular networks, warehouse and environment surveillance, news feed,etc.). In this thesis, we choose age as a distortion measure and derive expressions for the average age and the average peak-age (another age-related metric) for different communication systems. Therefore, we divide this dissertation into two parts: In the first part, we assume that the the updates are transmitted through a noiseless channel that has a random service time. In the second part, we consider a special category of noisy channels, namely the erasure channel. In the first part of this thesis, in order to compute the age-related metrics, we employ queue-theoretic concepts. We study and compare the performance of various transmission schemes under different settings.We show that the optimal transmission scheme when the monitor is interested in a single source loses its optimality when another source of higher priority shares the system. In the second part of this thesis, we introduce, in our age calculations, the distortion caused by the erasure channel on the transmitted updates. In order to combat the erasures of the channel, we first consider two flavors of the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). Finally, we focus on the optimal average age that could be achieved over an erasure channel."}

Such conditions, often presenting as one or more trivial symptoms observed over a short duration, can typically be resolved with minor adjustments in diet, lifestyle, and the removal of maintaining or exciting causes. This work examines the nature of indisposition, contrasting it with dynamic disease, which arises from disturbances in the vital force. By elucidating the defining characteristics of indisposition, this study provides a framework for its recognition, management, and resolution without resorting to dynamic treatments. It also highlights the importance of distinguishing between indisposition and fully developed diseases to ensure precise diagnosis and effective care. Ultimately, this exploration underscores the role of simple, harm-free measures in restoring vitality and supporting overall well-being."}

The literature shows that the computational methods are good alternatives for predicting the scour in hydraulic structures in which the conventional methods demonstrate shortcomings. In the present paper, various machine learning techniques have been used for the first time to predict the scour below the two symmetric crossing jets. Four types of artificial neural networks (ANNs), including feedforward back-propagation (FFBP), cascade-forward back-propagation (CFBP), radial basis function (RBF), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) along with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR) were employed and evaluated. Two important scour hole characteristics, namely the maximum scour hole depth and its location relative to the scour hole origin, were predicted at three crossing angles. The soft computing models were also compared with the traditional empirical methods. The results indicated that the applied computing techniques perform satisfactorily and improve the results remarkably. They can estimate the scour more precisely than the regression models and can be considered robust alternative tools. A detailed sensitivity analysis was also performed on the FFBP that shows the crossing angle has a powerful effect on the predictions. The SVR improved the results to 47% and 31.71% for the scour hole depth and its location, respectively, in terms of the correlation coefficient."}

We developed comorbidity indices predicting 1-year all-cause mortality from all comorbidities (DANCAMI) and restricted to non-cardiovascular comorbidities (rDANCAMI). For variable selection, we eliminated comorbidities stepwise using hazard ratios from multivariable Cox models. We compared DANCAMI/rDANCAMI with Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity indices using standard performance measures (Nagelkerke’s R\n2\n, Harrell’s C-statistic, the Integrated Discrimination Improvement, and the continuous Net Reclassification Index). We assessed the significance of the novel DANCAMI variables not included in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. External validation was performed in patients with myocardial infarction in New Zealand during 2007– 2016 (n=75,069).\n\nResults:\nThe DANCAMI included 24 comorbidities. The rDANCAMI included 17 non-cardiovascular comorbidities. In the Danish cohort, the DANCAMI indices outperformed both the Charlson and the Elixhauser comorbidity indices on all performance measures. The DANCAMI indices included multiple variables that were significant predictors of 1-year mortality even after controlling for all variables in the Charlson Comorbidity Index. These novel variables included valvular heart disease (hazard ratio for 1-year mortality=1.25, 95% CI: 1.14– 1.35), coagulopathy (1.13, 95% CI: 1.05– 1.22), alcohol and drug abuse (1.35, 95% CI: 1.15– 1.58), schizophrenia (1.60, 95% CI: 1.46– 1.76), affective disorder (1.29, 95% CI: 1.22– 1.36), epilepsy (1.26, 95% CI: 1.05– 1.50), neurodegenerative disorder (1.30, 95% CI: 1.10– 1.54) and chronic pancreatitis (1.71, 95% CI: 1.14– 2.56).

To clarify how long-term sulfamethoxazole (SMX) pressure converts macro-scale performance loss into micro-level mechanistic change, a continuous-flow aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (AGS-MBR) was operated for 140 days at SMX concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 mg L⁻¹. At 0.2–1 mg L⁻¹, the system remained resilient: TN and TP removal stabilized at 90% and 72.8%, respectively, and the volume-mean granule diameter remained 282 µm. Metagenomics revealed significant up-regulation of the glycogen-metabolising gene glk and the polyphosphate gene ppk , which fuelled an energy-compensation pathway that supplied ATP and precursors for TB-EPS synthesis and reinforced granule scaffolding. When influent SMX rose to 5 mg L⁻¹ this compensation collapsed: EPS dropped 45%, Dv shrank 38%, granules disintegrated, TN removal fell to 70% and TP to 44.8%. The community shifted to a filamentous bacteria dominated state with Thiothrix >25% relative abundance. Concurrently, the non-pathogen Rubrivivax became a shared host for antibiotic resistance genes ( sul1, sul2 ) and multiple transposases; mobile genetic elements mediated the co-transfer of resistance and virulence genes and eroded functional redundancy. LC-MS further showed that the major transformation products P4 and P6 exhibited 2.3 folds higher chronic toxicity than the parent compound and imposed additional chemical stress on the already impaired granule microbiota. SMX dose dictated a cascade in which metabolic compensation was followed by selection of filamentous hosts prone to gene mobility and finally by chemical toxicity, progressively dismantling granule structure, nutrient removal services and ecological safety. These results elucidate the dose-dependent macro-to-micro cascade under SMX stress and provide insights for mitigating ecological risks in antibiotic laden wastewater."}

Winkler spring-damper model is used to simulate the vertical dynamic interaction between soil around the pile and pipe pile, and between pile core soil and pipe pile by ignoring the radial displacement and circumferential displacement of soil. Considering the displacement boundary conditions of the soil around pile and pile core soil, the effects of the soil around pile and pile core soil on the pipe pile are obtained, and the complex stiffness of vertical vibration of a partially exposed friction pipe pile is obtained by using the initial parameter method and the transfer matrix method. The vertical dynamic interaction factor of partially exposed friction pipe pile-pipe pile is obtained by considering the dynamic interaction between pipe pile and pipe pile. Based on the principle of pile groups superposition and the vertical dynamic interaction factor of pipe pipe-pipe pile, the vertical vibration of partially exposed friction pipe pile groups is studied, and the vertical dynamic impedance of pipe pile groups is also obtained, and the influences of relevant parameters on the vertical dynamic impedance of partially exposed friction pipe pile groups are investigated by numerical examples of 3 × 3 pipe pile groups. The results show that the dynamic stiffness and damping of end-bearing friction pipe pile groups are larger than friction pipe pile groups, and the change of peak values of curves varying with frequency are gentler. The restraint effect of bedrock under pipe pile can increase the vertical dynamic impedance of pipe pile groups. Increasing the length of pipe pile is beneficial to increase the vertical dynamic impedance of pipe pile groups. The larger the pipe pile spacing, the sharper the peak values of curves of the dynamic stiffness and damping curves of pipe pile groups varying with frequency. The influence of pipe pile geometry on vertical vibration of pipe pile groups is greater than that of physical properties such as elastic modulus of pipe pile and shear modulus of soil."}

Phase Change Materials (PCMs), particularly sugar alcohols such as D-mannitol and erythritol, provide high latent heat capacity but suffer from inherently low thermal conductivity, resulting in slow solidification rates. To address this limitation, the present study proposes a novel dual nano-enhanced PCM (NEPCM) system embedded within a concentric cylindrical enclosure and augmented by tapered crossbar fins to improve solidification performance. A baseline configuration consisting of a tapered two-fin design with decreasing width (TTFDW) is introduced, against which various enhanced configurations are compared. The thermal behavior of dual PCMs is analyzed under different fin geometries, which include two and four fins with either increasing or decreasing width, and hybrid nanoparticle pairs at volume fractions ( ϕ ) up to 6%. Numerical simulations indicate that both fin structure and nanoparticle dispersion significantly influence solidification dynamics. Among the tested designs, the tapered four-fin configuration with increasing width (TFFIW) exhibited the most efficient solidification, owing to its improved conductive pathways and symmetric heat distribution. Relative to the TTFDW baseline using SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 at ϕ = 2%, the TFFIW configuration with SiO 2 -SWCNT at ϕ = 6% achieved a reduction in solidification time by 23.33%, and average temperature by 7.16% in the outer PCM and 6.28% in the inner PCM. The superior thermal properties of hBN and SWCNT further contributed to enhanced radial heat conduction and cooling uniformity. Solidification and temperature contours confirmed that increasing fin number and optimizing nanoparticle volume fractions reduced thermal gradients and minimized residual liquid zones, particularly in the inner PCM region. This integrated NEPCM-fin strategy offers a scalable and effective pathway for accelerating solidification and boosting thermal responsiveness in solar thermal storage systems. The proposed configurations show great promise in enhancing charge–discharge rates, cyclic durability, and overall performance of advanced latent heat energy storage technologies, particularly in concentrated solar power (CSP) plants where rapid and uniform thermal discharge is essential. The findings also highlight the potential for deployment in industrial-scale thermal receiver modules and other high-temperature latent heat storage units designed for continuous renewable energy utilization. • Dual sugar alcohol PCMs enhance thermal storage solidification efficiency. • Novel tapered crossbar fins promote multidirectional heat transfer and cooling. • Hybrid nanoparticles significantly improve solidification rate and temperature uniformity. • TFFIW configuration achieves 23.33% reduction in solidification time. • Fin geometry and nanoparticle loading minimize residual liquid regions."}

Success rate was defined as stone-free or residual fragment less than 4 mm. Pre-operative, operative and postoperative data were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 20 patients were included in the present study (12 males, 8 females). 9 of 25 renal stones (36 %) were located in the lower calyx of the kidney, whereas 7 (28 %) in the middle calyx, 5 (20 %) in the renal pelvis and 4 (16 %) in the upper calyx. The mean stone size was 17.8 ± 4.5 mm. The stone-free rate was 70 % after a single procedure. 6 patients required shock wave lithotripsy and two of these were completely stone-free. Average hospital stay was 1.4 ± 0.7 days. Minor complications as classified by Clavien I or II occurred in 25 %. No major complications (Clavien III–V) occurred in the study group. RIRS is an effective and safe treatment modality for renal stones in patients with HSK. The procedure has minimal morbidity and high success rate."}

Among them, peripheral neurotoxicity can be dose limiting. A liposomal formulation of cisplatin, Lipoplatin™, was developed to reduce the systemic toxicity of cisplatin but without preventing its efficacy. The aim of this study was to use an animal model to establish, through a multimodal approach, whether chronic treatment with two different schedules of Lipoplatin™, selected within the range of its anticancer effective dose, is less neurotoxic than cisplatin administration. Female Wistar rats were treated intraperitoneally with cisplatin at a dose of 4 mg/kg or with Lipoplatin™ at doses delivering 12 or 24 mg/kg of cisplatin once weekly for 4 weeks. General toxicity was assessed by daily observation, body weight change, hematological and blood chemistry analysis, and histopathology of liver and kidney. The onset of peripheral neurotoxicity was assessed by measuring tail nerve conduction velocity (NCV), morphological and morphometric analysis of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and morphological analysis of the sciatic nerve. Cisplatin induced a statistically significant reduction in body weight, the development of renal failure, and impairment in NCV with pathological alterations in the DRG and sciatic nerve. By contrast, Lipoplatin™ was markedly less nephrotoxic, and no significant weight gain reduction was observed in animals treated with both doses of the drug. Moreover, the lowest dose induced less severe damage to the peripheral nervous system with a moderate decrease in NCV and mild pathological alterations in DRG and the sciatic nerve. The results suggest that Lipoplatin™ 12 mg/kg is less neurotoxic than cisplatin 4 mg/kg, thus opening up the possibility of using this new formulation in future studies where its anticancer activity and the peripheral neurotoxicity will be assessed in parallel."}

Nanovaccines are a novel formulation comprised of nanomaterials coupled with an immunogenic component to elicit the immune response and provide protection against the desired infectious disease. The nanovaccines with unique physicochemical properties can be more efficient against targeting the desired tissues in the body, aids in prolong circulation to promote antigen-presenting cells to act upon the target antigens. The present review envisages the development of nanovaccines against antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. The use of nanovaccines can exhibit potent antigenicity with prolonged retention and controlled release to induce both cell- and antibody-mediated responses. Nanovaccines usage is still in the early stages and can be next-generation immunisation for prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency. The future development of nanovaccines against multi-drug-resistant pathogens can explore new avenues. Based on these facts, the present review is designed from the previously reported scientific studies and compiled with the fact that nanovaccines can revolutionise vaccine strategies. The articles were extracted from reputed databases like PubMed, Scopus, and ESCI. The size and conjugating chemistry of nanomaterials can be beneficial in developing novel multi-nanovaccine formulations that can target pools of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Overall, the nanovaccines can form one of the best effective modes of targeting multi-drug-resistant pathogens. The nanovaccines can stimulate the innate immune response and generate effective immune-therapeutic novel formulation against infectious pathogens. Based on these facts and considerations, the present article makes an alarming call to develop nanovaccines to counter multi-drug resistance."}

Effects of a moderate dose of red wine (≈ 40.98 g of ethanol) on consciousness were examined in a naturalistic study taking place in a wine bar located in one of the most touristic areas of Lisbon, Portugal. One hundred two participants drank in one of three conditions: alone, in dyad, or in groups up to six people. Red wine increased pleasure and arousal, decreased the awareness of time, slowed the subjective passage of time, increased the attentional focus on the present moment, decreased body awareness, slowed thought speed, turned imagination more vivid, and made the environment become more fascinating. Red wine increased insightfulness and originality of thoughts, increased sensations of oneness with the environment, spiritual feelings, all-encompassing love, and profound peace. All changes in consciousness occurred regardless of volunteers drinking alone, in dyad or in group. Men and women did not report different changes in consciousness. Older age correlated with greater increases in pleasure. Younger age correlated with greater increases in fascination with the environment of the wine bar. Drinking wine in a contemporaneous Western environment designed to enhance the pleasurableness of the wine drinking experience may trigger changes in consciousness commonly associated with mystical-type states.\n\nAuthor's selected publications\n\nCosta, R.

The challenge from categoricalism, which denies that fundamental properties possess any dispositional essence, motivates dispositional essentialists to adopt a hybrid view, according to which the essence of a fundamental property does not only consist of dispositional characters, but also categorical characters. However, as I demonstrate, this hybrid position is inconsistent with the common assumption that the categorical, unlike the dispositional, is non-modal. Likewise, the challenge from modern physics requires dispositional essentialists to revise their conception of the dispositional in order to accommodate new findings in quantum mechanics, such as invariance quantities and symmetry principles."}

A recent randomized trial found that ICS lowers systemic markers of inflammation such as serum C-reactive protein; this finding has led to speculation that ICS use may improve cardiovascular outcomes.\nMETHODS: In 1976, the Nurses' Health Study enrolled 121,700 married registered nurses, ages 30-55 years. Subjects were asked about “physician-diagnosed asthma” on biennial questionnaires. In 1998, asthmatic participants were sent a supplementary questionnaire on asthma diagnosis and management. Mortality was assessed through 2003, without knowledge of baseline ICS status. Odds ratios (OR) for death were adjusted for age, asthma severity, smoking, heart disease, cancer, stroke, aspirin, and statin use.\nRESULTS: Among 2,671 women who responded to the 1998 supplement (>80% response), met criteria for persistent asthma, and had no prior diagnosis of COPD, 54% reported ICS use. Over the next 5 years, 87 (3.3%) women died; 22 were cardiovascular deaths, 31 cancer, and 34 other (including 4 asthma). Compared to asthmatic women not on ICS, those on ICS had lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.92). ICS users were at significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.93) but not death from cancer (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.31-1.36) or other causes (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.29-1.26).\nCONCLUSION: ICS use was associated with a significant decrease in both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in women with asthma. These observational data suggest that ICS may indeed have anti-inflammatory benefits beyond the airway, a provocative hypothesis that merits further study."}

The number of NSCP patients is increasing and comprehensive guidelines specifying their optimal management have not yet been introduced. The objective of this review was to explore the prevalence and prognosis of NSCP versus ACS among patients recruited in consecutive series hospitalized for chest pain suspected to be ACS. This is a systematic literature search where three databases were searched from 1990 to 14 November 2011. In addition, one database was searched for Epub ahead of print per 24 March 2012. Three inclusion criteria were applied: 1. documentation of an unselected consecutive series of patients admitted for chest pain, where this review is based upon two groups of patients defined as follows: a) 'ACS/high-risk' and b) NSCP; 2. at least 100 cases with NSCP; and 3. follow-up of hospital readmissions and mortality for at least six months. A total of 2,204 citations were screened after removal of duplicates. Out of 80 full text articles assessed for eligibility 12 studies were included, comprising 24,829 patients (inter-study range 250 to 13,762), with 11,008 (44%) categorized as NSCP and 13,821 (56%) as 'ACS/high-risk'. The mean one-year total mortality rate among patients with NSCP in nine studies was 3.2% (inter-study range 1.4% to 8.1%), with the highest mortality among patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD). The mean one-year mortality rate among 'ACS/high-risk' patients was 18.0% (inter-study range 14.0% to 19.9%) in four studies with available data. In six studies the mean one-year readmission rate for patients with NSCP was 17.5% (inter-study range 2.5% to 40%). Patients with NSCP represent a large, heterogeneous and important group. Due to co-existing CHD in nearly 40% of these patients, their prognosis is not necessarily benign. Although their average one-year mortality rate was almost six times lower than those with 'ACS/high-risk', the subset with concomitant CHD had a relatively poor prognosis when compared with NSCP patients without evidence of CHD."}

The higher chromium contents of ODS ferritic steels, the better the corrosion resistance, which can meet the harsh corrosion environment of the advanced reactors. However, increasing the Cr content may also lead to the brittleness of the ODS steels when serving at high temperatures. The ODS ferritic steels with different Cr contents (12, 16 and 18 wt% Cr, respectively) were fabricated by mechanical alloying, hot isostatic pressing and forging. Mechanical properties and microstructure evolution of the ODS ferritic steels after aging at 753 K for 2000 h were investigated. It is found that both Vickers hardness and yield strength of 18%Cr ODS ferritic steel were strongly increased and the impact energy was decreased after aging at 753 K. In order to explore the reasons for changes in the mechanical properties, the fracture surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and microstructures after aging were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The impact fracture of 18%Cr ODS ferritic steel belongs to quasi-cleavage facture, which is consistent with its very low impact energy. The grain size and dispersed oxide particles of different ODS steels are very stable. M23C6 carbide and M2C carbide were found in 12%Cr ODS steel and 16%Cr ODS steels, respectively."}

It uses the theoretical lens of biographical learning (with its key concepts of agency and narrative) to explore what these interviews can tell us about the ways adults express the benefits of liberal adult education and its relationship to informal learning. Initial findings suggest that benefits are experienced as ‘bundles’ and that adults talk about their participation in adult education as a form of ‘taking control’ of their lives, including ‘choosing how to be old’ and glimpsing ‘fulfillment’. It also suggests that the ways adults talk about these benefits—and their wider biographical learning—can be used to identify a) foci for further national and pan-European analysis of the BeLL data; b) avenues for future research; and c) potentially fruitful theoretical lenses through which we can develop our understanding of the value of this and other interview data."}

While Power Africa has received praise for its early achievements, an analysis of its targets and the rationale behind them reveals attributional, developmental and technical issues: Power Africa lacks a clear definition which criteria have to be met before African electrification projects can be counted towards fulfilling Power Africa's targets, the targets themselves appear to be too low to deliver on Power Africa's promises, and they exhibit several technical inconsistencies. Crucially, this paper argues that contrary to the Trump administration's intention to reduce its funds, Power Africa's targets and efforts need to be increased to meet the initiative's own ambitions. • Power Africa's quantitative targets are analysed vis-à-vis its stated ambitions. • The targets are found to be inaccurate and insufficient to deliver on the ambitions. • New and increased targets are suggested to meet Power Africa's ambitions."}

The second section (paragraphs (5–7) is substantive. After defending the idea of ontology as the theory of the most general categories, and presenting the difference between substance and its determinations, the chapter claims that proper understanding of substance requires at least six different theories, five directly dealing with its internal configuration and one dealing with both internal and external aspects. These six ontological sub-theories address the following problems: (1) the differences among such general categories as object, process, event, state of affairs, stuff, group etc.; (2) classification; (3) structure, or types of whole and their parts; (4) chronotopoids, or types of spaces and times; (5) interactions, or forms of causation; and (6) levels of reality, or the distinction among the basic regions of reality, such as the material, the psychological and the social ones. The third section (paragraphs 8–11) touches briefly upon some of the remaining issues, for instance determinations, the substance-determination relation and predication and non-commutative categorical frameworks."}

The amount of redundant information that is sensed is decreased due to optimal network coverage, which also reduces the restricted energy consumption of battery-powered sensors. WSN sensors can sense, receive, and send data concurrently. Along with the energy limitation, accurate sensors and non-redundant data are a crucial challenge for WSNs. To maximize the ideal coverage and reduce the waste of the constrained sensor battery lifespan, all these actions must be accomplished. Augmented Nature-inspired algorithm is showing promise as a solution to the crucial problems in “Wireless Sensor Networks” (WSNs), particularly those related to the reduced sensor lifetime. For “Wireless Sensor Networks” (WSNs) to provide the best coverage, we focus on algorithms that are inspired by Augmented Nature in this research. In wireless sensor networks, the cluster head is chosen using the Diversity-Driven Multi-Parent Evolutionary Algorithm. For Data encryption Improved Identity Based Encryption (IIBE) is used.&nbsp; For centralized optimization and reducing coverage gaps in WSNs Time variant Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used.

With estimated $U$ and $J$ values, the $3C$ phase turns out to be a ferromagnetic metal, while the $4H$ phase shows paramagnetic behavior with vanishing ordered moments. However, this paramagnetic phase bears signatures of antiferromagnetic correlations, as confirmed by a calculation of the magnetic susceptibility. We find that the $4H$ phase is found to be at the verge of antiferromagnetic long-range order, which can be stabilized upon slight changes of screened Coulomb parameters $U$ and $J$, opening up the possibility of achieving a rare example of an antiferromagnetic metal."}

It has been established that the synthesized coalescents could be used to modify the properties of paints and varnishes based on polyurethane and styrene-acrylic aqueous dispersions. It has been shown that the product of the interaction between diethanolamine and boric acid in aqueous solutions forms an ionogenic complex compound with a unipolar conductivity in terms of ОН─ ions. It was also established that when introduced to the formulation of water-dispersion paints and varnishes, the solutions of modifiers produce a diluting action. The influence of ionic liquids on the process of film formation of aqueous dispersions of polymers and pigmented paints and varnishes based on them was investigated. It was established that the synthesized ionogenic compounds are not inferior, in terms of their effectiveness, to the widespread conventional industrial coalescents of the Texanol→ type.\nTherefore, there is reason to assert the possibility of replacing the industrial coalescent Texanol→ in the formulation of pigmented water-dispersion paints and varnishes based on styrene-acrylic and polyurethane dispersions with fundamentally new synthesized ionogenic modifiers. Thus, the coatings with a coalescent based on ion liquid of diethanolamine borate have a higher level of conditional hardness, which exceeds by 17 % the hardness index of the paint made on the basis of the conventional Texanol→ type coalescent, without changing its decorative properties, such as color and shine"}

The biblical myth of Lillith from the Talmud tells that she was Adam’s first wife and that she was punished by God for defending sexual pleasure and leaving her partner. On the one hand, Lillith represents the woman who rebels against the patriarchal order that controls her sexuality, and on the other, the individual who decides to live as an independent woman. Both of these stances make her a threat to the divine order. Escofet believes that Lillith has made frequent appearances throughout history in the guise of rebellious women traditionally labeled as bad. These include Joan of Arc, Anne Boleyn, The Bloody Countess, Mata Hari, and Bette Davis among others. Allende, in contrast, reconstructs the myth of Eve as a ‘pícara’, or, we might say, as the original Lillith. Her character recounts not only her own adventures and experiences but also those of other women who, in their rebellious opposition to traditional female roles, are considered bad or perverse. In these stories we find sexually precocious girls, prostitutes, mixed family groupings, and homosexual relationships presented as alternative possibilities for social organization. The resulting effect is that rather than being demonized, these independent women who break free of convention are reinterpretated as flexible individuals who are able to adapt. While such alternative models are taken from real life, it is in fiction that they may be considered to have come into full bloom."}

Fish submitted to SI also presented changes in the transcript levels of genes related to neural activity, and 5-HT/DA signaling. Interestingly, most of the behavioral and molecular changes induced by SI were not found again 6 days after SR. Thus, we highlight that SR of zebrafish to their conspecifics played a positive role in social behaviors and in the expression of genes involved in different neuronal signaling pathways that were altered after 12 days of SI. This study brings unprecedented data on the effects of SR in the recovery from SI neurobehavioral alterations, and reinforces the role of zebrafish as a translational model for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms adjacent to SI and resocialization. • Zebrafish social behaviors were impaired after SI. • SI altered neural activity and 5-HT/DA signaling in the zebrafish brain. • Social reintroduction recovered behavioral and molecular changes induced by the SI."}

In this cross‐sectional survey, a self‐designed online questionnaire was distributed among ESPNIC and EBMT members. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Over half of HSCT respondents employed a transfer indication protocol and patient assessment tool, but less structured checklist prior to patient transfer. Nearly all PICU respondents perceived this checklist as improvement for communication. Most HSCT and PICU physicians have daily rounds upon patient transfer while this is mostly missing between nursing teams. Half of both HSCT and PICU nurses indicated that HSCT training for PICU nurses could improve communication and patient transfer. Most respondents indicated that structured meetings between HSCT and PICU nurses could improve communication. Overall there is good communication between HSCT and PICU units, although barriers were noted between members of both teams.

Schisantherin A (SCA), a dibenzocyclooctadiene lignan monomer found in S. chinensis fruits has cardiovascular advantages such as increasing NO production in isolated rat thoracic aorta and reducing heart damage caused by ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) through decreasing apoptosis. The present study was undertaken to explore the potential effects of SCA on ISO-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Rats were randomly allocated to four groups: control; ISO-treated, and two additional groups of ISO + SCA (5 or 10 mg/kg body weight). All SCA-treated groups were administered with SCA for 20 days and all ISO groups were challenged with ISO on days 19 and 20. SCA significantly attenuated ISO-induced rise in heart/body weight ratio, myocardial infarct size, and cardiac functional biomarkers (CK-MB, cTnI and BNP). SCA pre- and co-treatment resulted in a significant reduction in oxidative stress (via MDA, NO and GSH and increased activities of SOD, CAT and GPx) and inflammation (via decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) markers when compared to the same levels in cardiac tissue of ISO-treated rats. This study also showed that SCA protects ISO-induced oxidative stress and inflammation by activating the PI3K-AKT/Nrf2/ARE pathway and suppressing TLR4/MAPK/NF-κB pathways. Furthermore, SCA treatment protected histopathological alterations observed in only ISO-treated cardiac transverse sections of rats. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that SCA protects against cardiac injury in the ISO-induced MI model of rats."}

Depending on the conditions (e.g., the specific application, the quality of service requirements, the user mobility) each session will be served through the most suited access network; following some event, there will be a variation of the access technology, which is called vertical handover. Although the use of one technology at a time is mostly envisioned, the use of multiple wireless links at the same time, hereafter called parallel transmission, is also envisioned for higher throughput. On the basis of parallel transmission, in this paper the original definition of softer vertical handover is given and an algorithm for softer vertical handover in heterogeneous wireless access networks is proposed; the achievable improvement is shown in two reference scenarios."}

Most previous studies assume a small number of demes or symmetrical structures that, most often, act as well-mixed populations. Other studies use network theory to study more heterogeneous spatial structures, however they usually assume small, regular networks, or strong constraints on the strength of selection considered. Here we build network generation algorithms, conduct evolutionary simulations and derive general analytic approximations for probabilities of fixation in populations with complex spatial structure. We build a unifying evolutionary theory across network families and derive the relevant selective parameter, which is a combination of network statistics, predictive of evolutionary dynamics. We also illustrate how to link this theory with novel datasets of spatial organization and use recent imaging data to build the cellular spatial networks of the stem cell niches of the bone marrow. Across a wide variety of parameters, we find these networks to be strong suppressors of selection, delaying mutation accumulation in this tissue. We also find that decreases in stem cell population size also decrease the suppression strength of the tissue spatial structure. Evolutionary models can help understand how the spatial arrangement of a population shapes its evolutionary dynamics. This study presents such a method and shows that the spatial architectures of stem cell populations in bone marrow are suppressors of selection, hinting at a potential evolutionary design."}

BoNTs act locally within motor neurons to elicit flaccid paralysis, while retrograde TeNT traffics to inhibitory neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) to elicit spastic paralysis. BoNT and TeNT are dichain proteins linked by an interchain disulfide bond comprised of an N-terminal catalytic light chain (LC) and a C-terminal heavy chain (HC) that encodes an LC translocation domain (HCT) and a receptor-binding domain (HCR). LC translocation is the least understood property of toxin action, but it involves low pH, proteolysis, and an intact interchain disulfide bridge. Recently, Pirazzini et al. (FEBS Lett 587:150–155, 2013, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.11.007) observed that inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) blocked TeNT and BoNT action in cerebellar granular neurons. In the current study, an atoxic TeNT LC translocation reporter was engineered by fusing β-lactamase to the N terminus of TeNT [βlac-TeNT(RY)] to investigate LC translocation in primary cortical neurons and Neuro-2a cells. βlac-TeNT(RY) retained the interchain disulfide bond, showed ganglioside-dependent binding to neurons, required acidification to promote βlac translocation, and was sensitive to auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase. Mutation of βlac-TeNT(RY) at C439S and C467S eliminated the interchain disulfide bond and inhibited βlac translocation. These data support the requirement of an intact interchain disulfide for LC translocation and imply that disulfide reduction is a prerequisite for LC delivery into the host cytosol. The data also support a model that LC translocation proceeds from the C to the N terminus. βlac-TeNT(RY) is the first reporter system to measure translocation by an AB single-chain toxin in intact cells."}

Poisson models were used to study temporal trends of disease prevalence (in terms of prevalence ratios, PR), whereas NGSP genotyping data from rams tested between 2005 and 2022 were used to study the temporal trend and geographical distribution of the percentage of susceptible animals. In addition, change-point regression analysis was used to identify changes in the trend. The trend in prevalence at the national level shows an increase in the period 2005–2015 (PR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.15), followed by a sharp decline between 2016 and 2022 (PR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.93). The proportion of susceptible rams shows a decreasing temporal trend, both along 2005–2022 (PR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96–0.98) and in the two periods (respectively, 2005–2015: PR 0.92, 95% CI 0.89–0.96; 2016–2022: PR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–0.98). Change-point regression analysis identified a nationwide trend shift between 2015 and 2020, with Sardinia showing an earlier change between 2012 and 2015. The analysis of temporal trends showed geographical heterogeneity associated with different control strategies, especially in Sardinia, where the early targeted interventions in 2009 anticipated most of the provisions of the second NGSP."}

Several recent studies have reported an association between the “on-off” phenomenon, concurrent mood changes and sensory symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. In these reports, “off” was associated with exacerbation of depression, anxiety and sensory symptoms, while “on” was accompanied by normalization of mood with occasional elation and attenuation in the severity of the sensory symptoms. These observations suggest that the biological mechanisms of the “on-off” interact with mechanisms regulating mood and sensory functions. The “on-off” phenomenon may be related to primary degenerative changes in the locus coeruleus (LC). The emergence of mood changes and sensory symptoms associated with the “on-off” may be facilitated by deregulation of LC-pineal melatonin functions. Administration of noradrenergic agents may be beneficial in attenuating the severity of the motor dyskinesias of the “on-off,” while serotonergic drugs alone or in combination with melatonin-release enhancing agents may be useful in the management of the mood changes and sensory symptoms."}

Second, to compare these optimal gestational ages with previously established optimal delivery timing for twin pregnancies not complicated by fetal growth restriction, which, in a previous individual patient meta-analysis, was calculated at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation for dichorionic pregnancies and 36 0/7 weeks for monochorionic pregnancies.\nDATA SOURCES: \nA search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Ovid between 2015 and 2018 was performed of cohort studies reporting risks of stillbirth and neonatal death in twin pregnancies from 32 to 41 weeks of gestation. Studies from a previous meta-analysis using a similar search strategy (from inception to 2015) were combined. Women with monoamniotic twin pregnancies were excluded.\nMETHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: \nOverall, of 57 eligible studies, 20 cohort studies that contributed original data reporting on 7,474 dichorionic and 2,281 monochorionic twin pairs.\nTABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: \nWe performed an individual participant data meta-analysis to calculate the risk of perinatal death (risk difference between prospective stillbirth and neonatal death) per gestational week. Analyses were stratified by chorionicity, levels of growth discordance, and presence of SGA in one or both twins. For both dichorionic and monochorionic twins, the absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were higher when one or both twins were SGA and increased with greater levels of growth discordance. Regardless of level of growth discordance and birth weight, perinatal risk balanced between 36 0/7–6/7 and 37 0/7–6/7 weeks of gestation in both dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies, with likely higher risk of stillbirth than neonatal death from 37 0/7–6/7 weeks onward.\nCONCLUSION: \nGrowth discordance or SGA is associated with higher absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death. However, balancing these two risks, we did not find evidence that the optimal timing of delivery is changed by the presence of growth disorders alone.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: \nPROSPERO, CRD42018090866.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn individual patient meta-analysis does not support that the optimal timing of delivery for twin pregnancies should be changed by the presence of growth disorders alone."}

This study fabricated dissimilar Nicrofer5520/Ti-6Al-4V joints using transient liquid phase (TLP) bonding with an Ag-Cu (BAg-8) interlayer. The effect of brazing temperatures in temperatures of 830, 860, 890, and 920 °C at a constant time of 20 min on microstructure and mechanical properties was investigated. Interfacial reactions and dissolution of parent metals significantly influenced the microstructural evolution, resulting in a layered structure, mostly composed of intermetallic compounds (IMCs). An increase in temperature influenced interdiffusion as well as the morphology and thickness of the phases. Shear strength varied between 198.5 and 229 MPa, influenced by the IMCs. Crack propagation primarily occurred in the Ni-DAZ, with partial extension along Ti-Cu IMCs, leading to a dominant cleavage fracture pattern attributed to the formation of brittle phases. This research provides valuable insights into the TLP bonding mechanism and demonstrates the feasibility of joining these materials, highlighting the importance of optimizing parameters for achieving sound joints. ● Transient liquid phase bonding temperature was decreased using an Ag-Cu Filler metal ● The acceptable mechanical performance was obtained during the TLP bonding process ● Morphology of Ti-Cu IMC changed from blocky to needle-like when temperature increased ● Failure initiated in Ni-based diffusion-affected zone and propagated in Ti-Cu IMCs ● Ag-Cu interlayer alleviates Ni-Ti intermetallic compounds"}

With the development of green chemistry, researchers are eager to develop separable and recyclable catalyst for methyl propionate production through ethylene hydroesterification. Herein, a novel zeolite-encapsulated Pd complex was developed for ethylene hydroesterification with CO and methanol to methyl propionate. The introduced Pd component is coordinated with 1, 2-bis (di- tert -butyl phosphinomethyl) benzene ligand to form Pd complex, which is encapsulated in USY zeolite. This scheme solves the challenge of coupling phosphine-palladium complexes with acid promoters as heterogeneous catalysts. It was found that the increasing density of Brønsted acid sites on USY zeolite favors the ethylene hydroesterification. Furthermore, the influences of catalyst preparation and reaction conditions on the catalytic performance were assessed. As a result, the ethylene conversion could reach 99 % with MP selectivity of 100 % under the optimal condition. In addition, the catalytic heterogeneity and stability of zeolite-encapsulated Pd complex were investigated."}

The autocatalytic behaviour shows generally a sigmoid change of the conversion. There are several types of autocatalytic equations—one is the Prout–Tompkins (PT) equation. The PT equation is a reaction kinetic model belonging to a series of models with a single reaction rate constant, which are favourably used in the field of reaction kinetic-based thermal analyses. The PT equation was developed and published in the 1940s by E.G. Prout and F.C. Tompkins, which tried to describe reaction kinetically their observations on the thermal decomposition of potassium permanganate. They recognized the autocatalytical behaviour of this decomposition and developed step by step the full autocatalytic description. But, in spite of using the full description with two reaction rate constants, they simplified the expression and kept only the autocatalytic part of the complete reaction scheme and of the rate equation by arguing that this part is much faster than the primary or intrinsic part and determines nearly totally the conversion of the substance. This can be right, depending on the system considered. But this simplification has resulted in a lot of application problems and also in problems to formulate the model in a correct way. In this paper, the problem is analysed and the viable solution will be given, which is called the improved PT model. Further, a lot of papers and applications can be found in the literature, which are a commingling of several concepts. The corresponding equations have an appearance as the PT equation, but in reaction kinetic terms, they are applied in a faulty way. This point is discussed also to dissolve the commingling and to foster the proper application of an autocatalytic description. For completion of the discussed equations and their usefulness in understanding the equations, the characteristic quantities ‘time to reach a certain degree of degradation’, ‘time to maximum rate’ and ‘conversion at maximum rate’ are presented. Finally, some other equations are discussed, which are able to describe autocatalytic behaviour in that they are transformed to the PT equation by choosing the appropriate reaction orders. However, not every sigmoid change in conversion is caused by autocatalysis, and in spite of this fact autocatalytic descriptions are used for such cases and one example of such a faulty use is discussed."}

We investigated the predictors for opioid requirements in upper limb fractures. \r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nWe retrospectively investigated all upper limb fractures from the shoulder to the wrist treated at a major trauma center from January 2015 to January 2022. The data collected consisted of fracture location, demographics, comorbidities, and management options. Post-injury opioid prescriptions in the first post-injury year were calculated every month up to six months and then grouped from the seventh to the 12th month and converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). We then calculated days requiring at least one medication (representing the “coverage”) and relative “strength” in each time period.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nSix thousand four hundred thirteen patients sustaining a combined 9125 fractures were included in the study, with an MME mean of 436. Fracture locations of the scapula, proximal humerus, humeral shaft, distal humerus, and proximal ulna all had significantly higher MME requirements (p&lt;0.05) at the one-year level. The radius shaft and distal radius had significantly lower MME requirements (p&lt;0.05).\r\n\r\nThe patients with depression, diabetes, drug abuse history, obesity, pulmonary circulatory disorder, and rheumatological conditions required higher strength of opioids at the one-year level (p&lt;0.05). The patients with chronic kidney disease, depression, pulmonary circulation disorder, and rheumatological conditions required higher coverage of opioids at the one-year level (p&lt;0.05).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nOur study presents a high-resolution breakdown of the post-injury opioid requirements for patients with upper limb injuries. Fractures of the scapula, proximal humerus, and shaft of the humerus were associated with increases in both opioid strength and coverage. Depression, pulmonary disease, and rheumatological conditions were all associated with increased opioid strength and coverage. This provides a framework for which clinicians and patients can more accurately anticipate the course of the rehabilitation journey and risk stratify appropriately at the outset of injury."}

Data regarding 1,662 HIV-1–infected women with live born singleton and first-born twin infants with information regarding PM and infant HIV-1 infection status at birth were analyzed. At the time of the study, women did not have access to antiretroviral drugs for treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but had received nevirapine prophylaxis to reduce the risk of MTCT of HIV-1. Placental malaria was not associated with the infant HIV-1 infection status at birth (P = 0.67). Adjustment for maternal plasma viral load and CD4+ cell count did not change these results (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 0.51–2.20, P = 0.87). Placental malaria was more likely to be related to HIV-1 infection at birth among women with low viral load at baseline (P for interaction = 0.08). In conclusion, PM was not associated with infant HIV-1 infection status at birth. The interaction of maternal plasma viral load, PM, and MTCT of HIV-1 warrants further studies."}

Therefore, the creation of a new brand, and its positioning on the market, has to be implemented carefully and in accordance with the global marketing strategy. Occasional business environment changes, however, require the company to frequently reposition itself on the market. In order to successfully respond to the challenges of the business environment, Niška mlekara opted for a strategy of market repositioning through the construction of a new brand called 'Vedro'. This strategy is based on: the creation of a new logo, product package redesign, quality improvement, assortment expansion and the change of level of consumers' awarness."}

Thus, educators (at least those of us who use versions of the traditional paradigm) need to broaden curricula to include methods of learning that develop and polish these essential skills. As support, the author develops an argument for the importance of concentration and contemplation as foundational academic competencies.

During hydrostatic creep, the strain rate response to magnesium chloride (MgCl2) brine injection is compared for water wet and mixed wet samples. For the mixed wet samples, the oil production was estimated during compaction and non-equilibrium MgCl2 flow. The results presented here were then compared to a similar test series on Kansas outcrop chalk. The differences were interpreted in terms of difference in physical parameters such as porosity and pore size. Two Mons samples were wettability-altered and tested in parallel to two completely water wet samples from the same chalk block at hydrostatic conditions and 130 °C. It was found that beyond the experimental uncertainty, the stiffness and yield strength measurements showed insignificant differences for water wet and mixed wet Mons samples. This is contrary to Kansas chalk where mixed wet samples were systematically stronger and stiffer than water wet samples. In the following creep phase, both water wet and wettability-altered Mons chalk samples gave trends comparable to each other during a stagnant phase and a following MgCl2 injection phase at varying flow rates. Similar observations were reported for water wet and wettability-altered Kansas chalks as well. Further, the same chemical reactions were observed for Kansas and Mons chalks and were found to be insensitive to the initial wettability and oil/water saturations. The oil production observations from Mons chalk showed that 43% of the total oil was recovered during early-stage compaction with no flow, whereas Kansas chalk did not produce any oil at no-flow conditions. After the oil recovery from the first 2–3 pore volumes of brine flow, no further oil production was observed due to compaction or non-equilibrium brine flow in any of the two chalk types."}

The study of surface phonons by means of an optical spectroscopy such as BLS has been historically constrained to nontransparent and highly reflecting bulk and film samples or even to very thin films deposited on reflecting substrates. Probably due to its low signal and to the narrow window in experimental conditions, it was assumed for years that bulk transparent samples were not suited for Brillouin spectroscopy in order to get information on SAWs, negating this optical technique in the search for SAW properties. The reported experiments on transparent glasses and single crystals (cubic MgO and trigonal sapphire) prove that there is no intrinsic physical reason not to collect SAW propagation velocity data from transparent bulk samples and opens a challenge to apply the Brillouin spectroscopy in a wider scenario to obtain direct information, in a nondestructive and contactless way, about SAWs in bulk materials."}

The study aimed to correlate serum interleukin 10 (IL-10) and interferon-gamma cytokines (IFN-γ) with oral candidiasis in T2DM. In this case–control study, 81 patients with T2DM and 41 non-diabetic individuals aged 30 to 70 years participated. Demographic information, a Blood sample (for blood glucose and cytokine tests), and an oral cotton swab sample from each individual were obtained. The samples were then incubated in a Sabroud dextrose agar medium. Colony growth was calculated and the type of yeast species in individuals with oral candidiasis was identified by culture in CHROMagar Candida medium. IL-10 and IFN-γ were measured by ELISA kit and the data were analyzed using SPSS-18. An overall of 122 participants comprised 73.77% females and 26.22% males. An increase in interleukin-10 by 40% and a decrease in IFN-γ by 6% can increase oral candidiasis prevalence among diabetic patients. Candida albicans was the most prevalent Candida species (spp.) in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups. The presence of oral candidiasis was not associated with HbA1c or FBS levels in both groups. In the diabetic population, an increase in IL-10 or a decrease in IFN-γ may be associated with an increased risk of oral candidiasis.\n"}

Condition-based maintenance of aero-engines requires real-time gas-path fault diagnosis, which is crucial for reducing costs and enhancing aircraft attendance. It is imperative to ensure a low false alarm rate in fault diagnosis algorithms. Inherent variations between engines and age-related performance deterioration can lead to an increase in false alarms, necessitating online algorithm tuning. However, insufficient fault data in online tuning may lead to class imbalance and algorithmic forgetfulness of fault features, compromising effectiveness. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a novel hybrid diagnosis algorithm that utilizes feature filtering and mapping. This method entails an engine model, a feature extractor, a feature filter, a fault classifier, and several feature mappers. The feature mappers are designed to generate fault features based on the incoming fault free data for rebalancing the tuning dataset. And the feature filter is introduced to prevent weight collapse during the online tuning. Validation through a 400-hour life cycle simulation test and a real data test indicate that the method outperforms the benchmark methods. It overcomes the class-imbalanced learning problem, showcasing its potential for aero-engine gas-path fault diagnosis."}

Pityriasis versicolor is considered by some to be nothing more than a very common, almost asymptomatic cosmetic burden, while phaeohyphomycosis is a less frequent, progressively disfiguring and sometimes fatal infection. Although the diseases may be quite opposite, their drug therapy has become a common feature for both infections.In the past, treatment of phaeohyphomycosis has been frustrating with options that included surgery and chemotherapy. Resection of the lesions is of course not always possible. Amphotericin B treatment has never given satisfactory results. Failure, relapse and toxicity were common events with this drug. Similar disappointments were obtained with miconazole IV and ketoconazole, or with combinations of these agents. When itraconazole became available, patients with phaeohyphomycosis were also exposed to this new drug. The first patients treated showed a rapid and dramatic response to this triazole derivative. Thus far, 26 patients with this infection have been treated with itraconazole. No therapeutic effect was seen in 8 of them. They continued to worsen during therapy. Thirteen patients showed clear improvement or complete remission, and stabilization of the disease was observed in 5 patients. These results suggest that itraconazole to date is the treatment of choice for phaeohyphomycosis, although further improvement of efficacy would be most welcome.Therapy for pityriasis versicolor has been much easier. Classical approaches include topical selenium sulphide, zinc pyrithione, tar and of course topical therapy with imidazole derivatives. The major problem with local treatment has always been the extent of the lesions, and the inability of the patients to treat the whole body area where the infection may occur. Treatment of pytiriasis versicolor has been revolutionized by the discovery of ketoconazole. This orally active imidazole derivative is excreted through the sweat very rapidly and at high concentrations. Short therapies of 200 mg daily for 5 to 10 days have resulted in more than 90% cure rates. Even the ultra-short treatment with 400 mg as a single dose has given cure rates of more than 70%. Needless to say, these very short treatment courses with ketoconazole are usually well tolerated. Itraconazole appears to be equally active as compared to ketoconazole; the more water-soluble triazole fluconazole and the allylamines are substantially less effective in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor.The development of ketoconazole in a shampoo formulation has added another treatment modality with this potent pityrosporucidal agent to the therapeutic armamentarium.Although the clinical picture and the course of phaeohyphomycosis and pityriasis versicolor are quite different, and although in the past this clinical difference was supplemented by a therapeutic difference since virtually no treatment existed for phaeohyphomycosis while acute episodes of pityriasis versicolor were relatively easy to manage, the availability of newer agents such as ketoconazole, but more importantly itraconazole, has created at least one common aspect between these 2 opposites of the spectrum of fungal infection. The availability of these newer azoles does not mean in any way that therapy of phaeohyphomycosis can be considered as optimal; and this in contrast to treatment of pityriasis versicolor. Further efforts have to be made to improve the therapeutic options for phaeohyphomycosis."}

First, a field survey was carried out where different habitat variables and the densities of both species were quantified and subjected to principal components analysis. Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues >1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month-long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.\n1.

Time- and frequency-resolved measurements of the OH (v = 1) fragments from vibrational predissociation showed that vibrationally activated D2−OH is short-lived and that the D2 fragment is vibrationally excited as a result of an efficient near-resonant vibration-to-vibration energy transfer process. The remaining 350 cm-1 of available energy is disposed primarily as rotational excitation of OH. The OH fragments also exhibit a striking lambda-doublet preference, revealing alignment of the unpaired pπ orbital with respect to the OH rotation plane that changes with the intermolecular state selected. The results are consistent with half-collisions that sample different restricted angular regions of the OH + D2 potential energy surface for each of the initially prepared states."}

Selected fuels should contain less or no carbon products from combustion process and eventually decrease the primary energy usage. Hydrogen has been taken into consideration. Previous researchers found that hydrogen can be used in spark ignition internal combustion engines. However, the optimum performance of an engine could not be achieved due to some limitations in regards the configurations of the air fuel ratio and compression ratio. In this work hydrogen fuel was tested in a single cylinder port fuel injection engine as the preliminary study in optimizing the engine performance. The engine performance study was based on the brake torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure (Bmep) and peak pressure. The engine model was developed based on the Modenas Kriss 110 cc 4-stroke single cylinder gasoline engine. The CATIA software was used in developing the 3D engine model and followed by utilization of GT-Suite software in analyzing the engine performance. From the analysis, it was found that the performance of the hydrogen fueled engine is lower compared to the gasoline engine."}

Most existing approaches formulate anomaly detection as a reconstruction/prediction problem established on the encoder-decoder structure. However, they suffer from the poor generalization performance when the model is directly applied to an unseen scene. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Anomaly Detection Network (AADNet) to realize few-shot scene-adaptive anomaly detection. Our core idea is to learn an adaptive model, which can identify abnormal events without fine-tuning when transferred to a new scene. To this end, in AADNet, a Segments Similarity Measurement (SSM) module is utilized to calculate the cosine distance of different input video segments, based on which the normal segments will be gathered. Meanwhile, to further exploit the information of normal events, we design a novel Relational Scene Awareness (RSA) module to capture the pixel-to-pixel relationship between different segments. By combining the SSM module with RSA, the proposed AADNet becomes much more generative. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate our method can adapt to a new scene effectively without fine-tuning and achieve the state-of-the-art performance."}

Here we create the concept of carbon-based entities (CBEs) which include methane, amino acids, proteins, bacteria, animals, plants, and other entities containing carbon atoms. We then deduce the driving force, the progressive mechanisms, and the major steps of CBE evolution from thermodynamics. We hence establish a comprehensive evolutionary theory termed the CBE evolutionary theory (CBEET), which suggests that evolution is driven hierarchy-wise by thermodynamics and favors fitness and diversity. The CBEET provides novel explanations for origin of life (abiogenesis), macroevolution, natural selection, sympatric speciation, and animal group evolution in a comprehensive and comprehensible way. It elucidates that collaboration, altruism, obeying rules with properly increased freedom are important throughout the CBE evolution. It refutes thoroughly the notion that negative entropy (negentropy) leads to biological order which is distinct from thermodynamic order. It integrates with research advances in multiple disciplines and links up laws of physics, evolution in biology, and harmonious development of human society."}

In this article I review the book and return to some of the key issues raised by MacAskill's decision and the broader context in which it was made. I argue that the book sheds little new light on Lockerbie and that it falls short in precisely the areas where MacAskill might have the most insight to offer. It is a rather bloodless and legalistic account that renders the complexities and the shades of grey of international politics in black and white.

As the field has expanded and matured, there is a need for rapid prototyping that is both accessible to most research groups and can readily translate toward scalable commercial manufacturing. Here, we describe a protocol that incorporates rapid computer numerical control (CNC) milling of positive molds, casting of a negative high-durometer silicone mold, and hot embossing to produce microfluidic devices composed of virtually any thermoplastic material. The method bypasses the need for high-precision machining of the bonding surfaces by using a cast acrylic stock and only milling channels, thus expanding this protocol to any CNC platform This technique represents a versatile, high-fidelity prototyping method that enables fast turnaround of prototype devices in a standard laboratory setting, while offering scalability for commercial manufacturing."}

From December 2009 to December 2022, 76 patients undergoing surgical treatment for AOPA in our hospital were enrolled. Two different reimplantation methods were used to correct the anomaly, including direct anastomosis in 45 (group A) and angioplasty with autologous tissue in 31 patients (group B). Early and late outcomes were compared between the two groups, and the independent risk factors for aberrant pulmonary artery(aPA) restenosis were determined. The median age at repair was 90 (8–1211) days. Hospital death occurred in two patients. During the follow-up period, there was no all-cause death. One patient in group A was lost to follow-up. Freedom from postoperative aPA restenosis at 1, 5, and 10 years in A group was 92.3, 85.4, and 85.4%, respectively. Freedom from postoperative aPA restenosis at 1, 5, and 10 years in B group was 75.2, 63.3, and 57.5%, respectively (log-rank, P = 0.038). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that smaller innate Z-score of aPA and angioplasty with autologous tissue were independent risk factors for aPA restenosis. Freedom from reintervention for aPA restenosis at 1, 5, and 10 years in A group was 97.1, 93.0, and 93.0%, respectively. Freedom from reintervention for aPA restenosis at 1, 5, and 10 years in B group was 95.7, 85.3, and 77.5%, respectively (log-rank, P = 0.235). Surgical reimplantation in AOPA patients has resulted in favorable long-term outcomes. Direct anastomosis is superior to angioplasty with autologous tissue in avoiding late aPA restenosis. Intrinsic dysplasia of aPA also increases the incidence of stenosis. However, the type of reimplantation did not significantly affect late reintervention."}

And the juvenile science of biology only got its first master work – Darwin's ‘On the Origin of Species’ – a mere 150 years ago. The development of the subject has also been extraordinarily fertile, particularly in the last three centuries, and it is perhaps only in the last century that the other sciences have begun to approach mathematics in the steady accumulation of knowledge that it has been able to offer. There has, moreover, been almost universal agreement on its methods and how they are to be applied. What we require is proof; and, in practice, there is very little disagreement over whether or not we have it. The other sciences, by contrast, tend to get mired in controversy over the significance of this or that experimental finding or over whether one theory is to be preferred to another."}

Charge proceeds in the counter-direction by consumption of dissolved superoxide anions and dissolution of NaO2. Indirect evidence for the solution-precipitation route is provided by theoretical results on the electronic structure of NaO2 and the conclusion that the electronic conductivity of NaO2 is too low to allow direct electrochemical growth and dissolution. Direct evidence for the solution-precipitation route is provided by results from charge/discharge studies of a three-electrode cell in which preformed NaO2 is being decomposed without direct electronic contact to the charging circuit. An analytical model for the overvoltage as a function of electrode coverage with electrically insulating discharge product complements the theoretical and experimental results and supports the mechanistic findings."}

However, the long-term efficacy of LMV may become limited by the emergence of antiviral-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) mutants. The two most common LMV-resistant mutants produce changes in the viral polymerase protein (rt) of rtM204I and rtL180M/M204V (previously rtM550I and rtL526M/M550V). A number of studies have demonstrated that these HBV mutants appear to be replication impaired, both in vitro and in vivo. The detection and selection of compensatory mutations in the polymerase protein that restore the replication phenotype of these HBV mutants have been poorly described to date. The effects of mutations in the fingers subdomain of the viral polymerase protein arising as a consequence of vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) selected changes in the overlapping envelope gene (S), and a determinant of the hepatitis Bs antigen (HBsAg) were analyzed in vitro. The LMV-resistant HBV mutants rtM204I and rtL180M/M204V produced substantially weaker HBV DNA replicative intermediate signals by Southern blot analysis and less total intracellular HBV DNA by real-time PCR compared to wild-type virus. The viral polymerase protein of these mutants produced little detectable radiolabeled HBV DNA in an endogenous polymerase assay. In contrast, the HBV a determinant HBIg/vaccine escape mutants sP120T, sT123N, sG145R, and sD144E/G145R (that produce rtT128N, Q130P, rtW153Q, and rtG153E respectively) yielded as much virus as wild-type HBV while the sM133L (rtY141S) mutant was replication impaired. Two of these mutants, rtT128N and rtW153Q, when introduced into a replication-competent HBV vector containing the rtL180M/M204V polymerase mutation restored the replication phenotype of this LMV-resistant mutant. These viruses produced levels of intracellular HBV DNA as determined by Southern blot and real-time PCR that were comparable to those of wild-type HBV, indicating that the changes in the fingers subdomain were able to compensate for the reduced replication of the LMV-resistant mutations. Since these viruses carry mutations in the a determinant of HBsAg that may potentially decrease the ability of anti-HBs antibody to neutralize these viruses, these HBV mutants also have the potential to behave as vaccine escape mutants."}

One of the attractive tools is ball bearings. These balls support the load of the application as well as minimize friction between the surfaces. If a heavy load is applied to a ball bearing, there is the risk that the balls may be damaged and cause the bearing to fail earlier. Hence, we aim to study the model of the failure times of ball bearings. A hybrid Type-II censoring scheme is recommended to minimize the experimental time and cost where the components are following alpha power inverse Weibull distribution. A ball bearing is one example; the other is the resistance of guinea pigs exposed to dosages of virulent tubercle bacilli. We use different estimation methods to obtain point and interval estimates of the unknown parameters of the distribution; consequently, estimating statistical functions such as the hazard rate and the survival functions are observed. The maximum likelihood method and the maximum product spacing methods are used, in addition to the Bayesian estimation method, in which symmetric and asymmetric loss functions are utilized. Interval estimators are obtained for the unknown parameters using three different criteria: approximate, credible, and bootstrap confidence intervals. The performance of the parameters&rsquo; estimation is accomplished via simulation analysis and numerical methods such as Newton&ndash;Raphson and Monte Carlo Markov chains. Finally, results and conclusions support the suitability of alpha power inverse Weibull distribution under a hybrid Type-II censoring scheme for modeling real biomedical data."}

Moreover, this study shows that female students have better performance in theoretical understanding. While the male students show better performance in the practical skill that is assessed in the course project. In addition, this study reveals that even though they are a majority in the Biomedical Engineering Program, female students have relatively low confidence and tend to assess their contribution in the course project more leniently.

Diagnosis of rupture was based on clinical symptoms and characteristic imaging findings, including hemoperitoneum. TAE was performed via superselective catheterization using a DMSO-compatible microcatheter, with slow injection under fluoroscopic guidance. Tumor response was assessed using modified RECIST and volumetric analysis at 1, 3, and 6 months. Technical success was achieved in all cases, with immediate bleeding control and no procedure-related complications. Portal vein patency was preserved, and all patients were discharged within 3–5 days. At follow-up, all patients showed sustained devascularization and tumor shrinkage, with an average volume reduction exceeding 60% at 6 months. Two patients became eligible for curative-intent surgery after marked radiologic and biologic response, including one with AFP decline from 3500 to 27 ng/mL. A third declined surgery despite downstaging, and one demonstrated complete radiologic response without additional treatment. TAE with low-viscosity EVOH was safe and effective in the acute setting of r-HCC, achieving rapid hemostasis and consistent tumor regression. These findings support further prospective evaluation of non-adhesive liquid embolics beyond emergent indications, including their potential oncologic role in unresectable HCC.

For each cerebral defect, the main imaging findings are reminded, certain differential diagnoses are discussed and prenatal diagnostic accuracy is analyzed with emphasis on uncertainties encountered during analysis of ultrasound or magnetic resonance images. Detecting cerebral lesions in fetuses requires rapid counseling by neuropediatricians. Keeping in mind that the prenatal diagnostic accuracy is not 100%, the neuropediatricians have to answer the parents' questions regarding the outcome of the unborn child as well as the risk of recurrence for future pregnancies. This article is based on the authors' large experience in both prenatal imaging and neurocounseling. The frequently asked questions are set up. Answers are provided, underscoring the importance of an appropriate description of the cerebral defect, and therefore the pivotal role of prenatal imaging. However, prenatal neurocounseling remains challenging and the parents must be aware of uncertainties regarding both diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation."}

This study assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of methods to classify colonoscopy indication, including referring provider impression, endoscopist impression, and administrative algorithm compared with gold standard chart review. Methods: We randomly sampled 400 patients undergoing a colonoscopy at a Veterans Affairs health system between January 2010 and December 2010. Referring provider and endoscopist impressions of colonoscopy indication were compared with gold-standard chart review. Indications were classified into 4 mutually exclusive categories: diagnostic, surveillance, high-risk screening, or average-risk screening. Results: Of 400 colonoscopies, 26% were performed for average-risk screening, 7% for high-risk screening, 26% for surveillance, and 41% for diagnostic indications. Accuracy of referring provider and endoscopist impressions of colonoscopy indication were 87% and 84%, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of the administrative algorithm (45%; P<.001 for both). There was substantial agreement between endoscopist and referring provider impressions (κ=0.76). All 3 methods showed high sensitivity (>90%) for determining screening (vs nonscreening) indication, but specificity of the administrative algorithm was lower (40.3%) compared with referring provider (93.7%) and endoscopist (84.0%) impressions. Accuracy of endoscopist, but not referring provider, impression was lower in patients with a family history of colon cancer than in those without (65% vs 84%; P=.001). Conclusions: Referring provider and endoscopist impressions of colonoscopy indication are both accurate and may be useful data to incorporate into algorithms classifying colonoscopy indication."}

An analysis of the sources of growth is an allocation of changes in output among these determinants. Total factor input and output per unit of input condense all determinants into two groupings.

The classification suggested in this paper is detailed enough to bring out points at which description is required but often overlooked. Some effects of alternative estimating procedures on classification are described.\nThe relative usefulness and practicality of possible alternative classifications also need consideration and discussion. This paper is concerned with general purpose classifications, appropriate for analysis of actual series measuring a country's total output, that are suitable for present use but will also accommodate useful detail that may later become feasible. A desirable classification will so specify determinants that (1) they both unite cause with effect and correspond to the economist's method of analysis so that his set of tools can be brought to bear; (2) they do not contribute to growth if they do not change; and (3) they conform as well as possible to practical possibility of estimation. Among several points considered fundamental are that the complete contributions of advances in knowledge and of resource reallocation each appear as an entity. They should not be dispersed among inputs or other determinants. It is less clear whether economies of scale should be a separate determinant or their contribution be dispersed."}

This research examines sensor data to evaluate variations in critical parameters and their effects on structural integrity. It also compares the efficacy of two deep learning algorithms, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer, in predicting structural conditions. The findings indicate that the Transformer model exhibits high reliability in forecasting and is particularly adept at handling extended periods and intricate time series data, rendering it especially appropriate for health assessments of immersed tube structures. Three correlation analysis techniques are employed to calculate correlation coefficients, thereby identifying the parameters that exert the most significant influence on structural health. The CRITIC method is utilized to assign weights to these parameters. Subsequently, a structural health evaluation model based on the fusion of multi-source information is proposed, facilitating the assessment of the immersed tube’s condition and enabling predictions regarding its status over the subsequent 12 to 24 h. This proactive methodology offers a comprehensive insight into the tunnel health, allowing for implementing preventive measures before the emergence of issues and ultimately reducing maintenance costs. The practical implications of this research are significant, as it provides a robust methodology for the real-time monitoring and evaluation of subsea-immersed tunnels, thereby enhancing their operational safety and reducing maintenance costs."}

He was admitted because of sudden hematemesis. A bronchoscopic examination revealed a lobulated polypoid tumor located in the left and right bronchi. Histologically, most tumor cells had abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and were immunoreactive for S-100, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CD68 and vimentin. Moreover, osteopontin-positive tumor cells were randomly distributed in the tumor tissue, but few stromal cells were positive. In contrast, osteonectin was mainly expressed in the peripheral tumor cells and was also distributed in the stromal cells. Blood vessels at the tumor border in which osteonectin-positive tumor cells were distributed, proliferated moderately. These results suggest that osteopontin and osteonectin may play a role in the progression of granular cell tumors and in the interaction between the tumor and host or angiogenesis around the tumor, respectively."}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate PA behavior among university employees before and after moving into a new building. Methods: A pre–post, experimental versus control group study design was used. PA data were collected using surveys and accelerometers from university faculty and staff. Accelerometry was used to compare those moving into the new building (MOVERS) and those remaining in existing buildings (NONMOVERS) and from a control group (CONTROLS). Results: Survey results showed increased self-reported PA for MOVERS and NONMOVERS. All 3 groups significantly increased in objectively collected daily energy expenditure and steps per day. The greatest steps per day increase was in CONTROLS (29.8%) compared with MOVERS (27.5%) and NONMOVERS (15.9%), but there were no significant differences between groups at pretest or posttest. Conclusions: Self-reported and objectively measured PA increased from pretest to posttest in all groups; thus, the increase cannot be attributed to the new building. Confounding factors may include contamination bias due to proximity of control site to experimental site and introduction of a university PA tracking contest during postdata collection. Methodology and results can inform future studies on best design practices for increasing PA."}

A novel method for polarimetric radar data processing and visualization, path-CVP (pCVP), is introduced. It represents radar data in height vs. location format at the time of a completed radar volume scan. pCVP, an offspring of CVP, is a single-radar-volume time snapshot of the polarimetric radar data along an arbitrary or predefined path with high spatial resolution. Multiple examples from S-band WSR-88D radars in the NEXRAD network demonstrate the potential usage and advantages of the technique. Monitoring and quantifying instantaneous weather conditions with polarimetric radar along motorways, mountain overpasses, and aircraft paths during descent and ascent from the runway, as well as tornado location diagnostics, are potential benefits of the novel technique. However, the increasing distance from the radar and the size of the area used for CVP spatial averaging may need to be adjusted based on user needs.</p>"}

Dez dias após a inoculação, folhas apresentando mosaico foram utilizadas para DAS-ELISA e extração de RNAs totais. Em ELISA, houve reação apenas contra o anti-soro específico para CMV subgrupo I. Através de RT-PCR com primers desenhados para anelar em regiões conservadas da porção terminal 3' do gene da capa protéica, foi amplificado um fragmento de DNA com 486 pares de bases. O produto obtido via RT-PCR foi submetido à digestão com as enzimas EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI e MspI, obtendo-se um padrão de restrição esperado para o subgrupo I. Estes resultados foram confirmados através do seqüenciamento do produto de PCR, o qual apresentou homologia de 96% a 98% com os isolados do CMV pertencentes ao subgrupo I. Pelos sintomas observados na hospedeira diferencial Vigna unguiculata, o isolado foi confirmado como sendo do subgrupo Ia."}

Experimental studies suggest a framework to evaluate the asynchronous nature of grapevine maturation and to propose a simple model to simulate dry matter and water dynamics.Methods and results:Amethodology based on the measurement of the density of the berries was used, providing information on the dry matter, water content and distribution of the berry populations during the veraison - harvest period. The main experiment was carried out in Rhone valley vineyards on the«Grenache N » and « Syrah » varieties. Additional information was gathered in Burgundy vineyards on « Pinot noir » and « Chardonnay » varieties. A relationship between the sugar content (°Brix) and water content of a berry was observed, which was robust and identical for all varieties. The asynchronous nature of berry growth was confirmed and densimetry allows quantifying the homogeneity of harvest. A model was proposed to modelling dry matter growth, based on thermal time and final potential dry weight. A single relationship was obtained for the two varieties studied which seemed to be independent of field conditions (soil and year). To model water content dynamics (or °Brix, using the relationship obtained between them), two components were defined, one of which is related to the berry phenological stage and the other depends on the water status of the plant.Conclusion: The results provide a conceptual framework to better understand and represent the dynamics of dry matter accumulation and water content of a population of grape berries, and to evaluate the asynchronous nature of grapevine maturity.Significance and impact of the study: The models and relationships proposed could be used as a tool to better identify and understand key factors and processes occurring in the field until the detailed processes of berry growth are better understood and can be incorporated into the model. This model could be incorporated into a crop model of vine growth."}

Advancing climate change will necessitate the use of new distributions that are more flexible in adapting to changes in stationarity or the presence of trends in the sample. In this work, we compare the best fit of three-parameter distributions such as lognormal, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Pearson type III, and a new extension of GEV &ndash; Dual Gamma Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GGEV) under different trends in the time series and by adding criteria such as catchment area and peak flow magnitude. The research pertains to catchments in the temperate climate zone of Poland, covering 678 water gauges in 340 rivers. Based on a trend criterion, the GGEV distribution compared to the analyzed three-parameter distributions, and the GEV distribution compared to the other three-parameter distributions, were the best fit for most samples. Based on the trend criterion and catchment size it was found that the GEV distribution is best suited for micro- and meso-catchments, while the GGEV distribution is ideal for macro- to large-catchments where the series exhibits a trend, either positive or negative. The major benefit of the GGEV distribution is its flexibility when the data are influenced by temporal non-stationarities. The additional shape parameter compensates for the limitations of the other shape parameter in distributions with lighter tails. Analysis of the dependence relationships between environmental indicators such as geographic, physiographic and hydrological indicators and the distribution parameters is less conclusive. In order to test the risk of overparameterization and overfitting for the distributions with more parameters, Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and K-Fold cross validation shows that the GEV and GGEV distributions perform better compared to the exponential and two-parameter lognormal distributions. As an overall conclusion, the study showed that for the analyzed samples in the temperate climate zone in the era of climate change, distributions that better respond to trends, like GGEV, are more likely to be applied.</p>"}

Most evidence related to digital crime are kept within the computer system files. This article explores and evaluates the applicability of Neural Network techniques in DF analysis by analysing information related to computer's file system to determine whether they have been manipulated by a specific application program. A data set described as a vector of attributes related to file system activities thru a specific time is collected and utilized for creating a neural network classification model. The experimental results show good results with respect to different performance estimation measures."}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the transmission of wound signals by MAPKs has been the subject of detailed investigations; however, the involvement of specific phosphatases in wound signaling is not known. Here, we show that AP2C1, an Arabidopsis Ser/Thr phosphatase of type 2C, is a novel stress signal regulator that inactivates the stress-responsive MAPKs MPK4 and MPK6. Mutant ap2c1 plants produce significantly higher amounts of jasmonate upon wounding and are more resistant to phytophagous mites (Tetranychus urticae). Plants with increased AP2C1 levels display lower wound activation of MAPKs, reduced ethylene production, and compromised innate immunity against the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our results demonstrate a key role for the AP2C1 phosphatase in regulating stress hormone levels, defense responses, and MAPK activities in Arabidopsis and provide evidence that the activity of AP2C1 might control the plant's response to B. cinerea."}

Despite WHO’s assertion that disabled persons deserve equal access to healthcare, disparities remain. Health professionals play a pivotal role in reducing maternal mortality. Yet few studies engage professionals to understand these perceptions and how they shape service provision. This highlights the need for research investigating health professionals’ perceptions of delivering maternal healthcare to women with disabilities in Ghana. With the aid of a qualitative approach, this study explored the perceptions of healthcare professionals on disabled women who sought maternal healthcare in Ghana. Data was gathered from 25 healthcare workers, consisting of midwives and doctors. The thematic analysis uncovered two contrasting themes—positive perceptions highlighting the determination and strength of disabled women and negative perceptions shaped by cultural biases questioning the need for disabled women to become pregnant. Bridging this gap necessitates comprehensive training, patient-centred collaborative approaches, and anti-discrimination policies to establish an equitable Ghanaian healthcare system that safeguards the reproductive rights and options of pregnant and disabled women. Dedication from all stakeholders is imperative to ensure inclusiveness and fair treatment."}

Since patients with multiple enchondromas have occasionally been reported to have these conditions, we hypothesized that the same mutations would occur in cartilaginous neoplasms. Approximately 1200 mesenchymal tumours, including 220 cartilaginous tumours, 222 osteosarcomas and another ∼750 bone and soft tissue tumours, were screened for IDH1 R132 mutations, using Sequenom® mass spectrometry. Cartilaginous tumours and chondroblastic osteosarcomas, wild-type for IDH1 R132, were analysed for IDH2 (R172, R140) mutations. Validation was performed by capillary sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Heterozygous somatic IDH1/IDH2 mutations, which result in the production of a potential oncometabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, were only detected in central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours, and were found in at least 56% of these, ∼40% of which were represented by R132C. IDH1 R132H mutations were confirmed by immunoreactivity for this mutant allele. The ratio of IDH1:IDH2 mutation was 10.6 : 1. No IDH2 R140 mutations were detected. Mutations were detected in enchondromas through to conventional central and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, in patients with both solitary and multiple neoplasms. No germline mutations were detected. No mutations were detected in peripheral chondrosarcomas and osteochondromas. In conclusion, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations represent the first common genetic abnormalities to be identified in conventional central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours. As in gliomas and AML, the mutations appear to occur early in tumourigenesis. We speculate that a mosaic pattern of IDH-mutation-bearing cells explains the reports of diverse tumours (gliomas, AML, multiple cartilaginous neoplasms, haemangiomas) occurring in the same patient.

We compared the expression of AnxA2 in primary myeloma cells from MM patients with that in normal plasma cells from normal subjects and found that myeloma cells from patients had higher expression of AnxA2. Expression of AnxA2 was also significantly higher in MM cell lines U266 and RPMI8226, compared with other hematologic tumor cell lines. Transfecting U266 and RPMI8226 cells with the small interfering RNA (siRNA) that targets human AnxA2 led to significant downregulation of AnxA2 expression, which resulted in the decreased proliferation, invasive potential and increased apoptosis of U266 and RPMI8226 cell lines. Silencing AnxA2 gene by siRNA also inhibited the expression of pro-angiogenic molecules including VEGF-C, VEGF-R2, MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 in the two cell lines. Our data suggested that the AnxA2 is overexpressed in MM patients and myeloma cell lines U266 and RPMI8226, and that AnxA2 overexpression appeared to affect the proliferation, apoptosis, invasive potential and production of pro-angiogenic factors in MM cell lines U266 and RPMI8226."}

MicroRNAs are known to act as remarkable regulators of biological pathways, monitoring, and treatment of diseases including respiratory problems. In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-106a-5p and miR-106b-5p, two regulators of TGF-  β signaling, as well as their target molecule, TGFβ1I1, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SM-exposed individuals.Materials and methods: 70 veterans with SM-induced pulmonary complications were examined and compared to 35 gender and age-matched healthy controls. After clinical examination and pulmonary function tests, the severity of pulmonary complications was classified. Total RNA was extracted from PBMCs and the purity of extracted RNA samples was evaluated by a NanoDrop 2000. miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p and TGFβ1I1 expression levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR.Result: The miR-106a-5p expression levels were significantly increased in both mild (p =0.015) and severe groups compared with control group. miR-106b-5p expression levels were considerably elevated in the severe group.  TGF  β1I1 expression levels were notably reduced in the severe group compared with the control group. Although, a slight decrease in TGFβ1I1 expression levels was observed in the mild group compared with the control.Conclusion: Our result indicate that exposure to sulfur mustard affects the expression of miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p, and their target gene, TGFβ1I1, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Considering the role of TGFβ1I1 in the regulation of TGF-β signaling, the mentioned changes might point to a potential mechanism by which SM exposure causes chronic pulmonary complications. In a ROC analysis, miR-106a-5p and miR-106b-5p potentially turned out to be a suitable diagnostic biomarker in the mild and severe categories of patients. Although miR-106a-5p could be considered as a better biomarkers than miR-106b-5p. "}

This study aims to analyze global patterns in the incidence and primary causes of femoral shaft fractures.\n\nMethods:\nData from the Global Burden of Disease database were analyzed for femoral fractures (excluding femoral neck fractures) by age, gender, and socio-demographic index regions. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to assess trends in the incidence of femoral shaft fractures.\n\nResults:\nGlobal femoral fracture cases increased from 8,559,886 in 1990 to 11,566,429 in 2021, a rise of 35.12%. However, the incidence rate dropped from 160.49 to 146.57 per 100,000 (EAPC: − 0.35). Males consistently had higher rates, reaching 155.53 per 100,000 in 2021. The 15– 49 age group recorded the most cases, while individuals aged 75 and older saw the largest rise in incidence, from 445.91 to 603.32 per 100,000. In 2021, Slovenia (616.1 per 100,000), Croatia (568.51 per 100,000), and Czechia (434.77 per 100,000) reported the highest rates, while Malawi, Kiribati, and Liberia had the lowest (< 63 per 100,000). Leading causes were mechanical forces, motor vehicle injuries, and pedestrian injuries, with notable regional disparities.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough the global incidence rate of femoral shaft fractures has declined, it has risen significantly among older adults, increasing their burden. Understanding regional variations in causes is crucial for developing targeted public health interventions to address this growing issue.\n\n\nKeywords:\nfemoral shaft fractures, global epidemiology, incidence, injury\n\n"}

Relman", "affiliations": [], "is_corresponding": false}], "abstract": "Prologue: In the six years that Arnold Relman has served as editor of The New England Journal of Medicine , this weekly publication has devoted evermore attention and space to publishing a range of views on health policy issues. The emphasis is in keeping with Relman s penchant to inform his largely physician audience on issues beyond their everyday clinical activities. Obviously, though, the central purpose of the journal is to keep practitioners on the cutting edge of change in clinical medicine. Relman, a philosopher-physician who brings to his editorship a thirty-year perspective as a nephrologist, medical educator, and clinical researcher, often contributes to this dialogue, offering opinions on subjects ranging from nuclear war and physicians to treatment of end-stage renal disease to Moscow in January and more. But in no instance has Relman devoted more space or personal fervor than he did in the fall of 1980 when he wrote “The New Medical-Industrial Complex,” an article that remains as controversial today as the day it was published. Relman's focus is the physician and his (and increasingly) her role in society. Relman believes to the core of his professional being that medical practice has a crucial moral component: the commitment of the doctor to the patient, to put the patient's interest above his own, and always to do what is in the patient's best interest to the best of his ability. He said in an interview not long ago: “When doctors begin seeing themselves as businessmen, simply selling a highly technical service, that will be the beginning of the end for the profession. “In this article, adapted from the Merrimon Lecture which Relman delivered at the University of North Carolina last October, he urges the medical profession to recognize this danger and address it. Relman asks not that society change, but that doctors be steadfast in maintaining “responsible professionalism.” He has delivered this plea to the American Medical Associations Board of Trustees and in other bastions of medical influence. Coming as it does from the most powerful man in medical publishing today, it's not a message that the profession can afford to take lightly."}

This clearly suggests that the key to a reduction of the HIV infection rate is a change in our sexual behaviour. In this article, therefore, I want to propose some guidelines “Towards a New Christian Sexual Ethics in the Light of HIV/AIDS”, and take into consideration various aspects of an African context. Next to upholding the positive value of our sexuality as part of God's good creation, we have to empower women to determine for themselves if, when, how and with whom they want to have sexual contact. We have to emphasise values like intimacy, love, commitment and responsibility, and we should discourage casual sex and prostitution. We may also have to reconsider the relationship between sexual relationships and activities and marriage. While confirming marriage as the ideal context of sexual relationships and activities, we may encourage people to practice their sexuality only within long-term permanent relationships that should be characterised by the principles stated above.\nHowever, since we know that humans are not perfect, we have to reckon with people who are either unwilling or unable to follow the proposed guidelines, and at this point we, as churches and Christians, cannot avoid the discussion about condoms. According to my point of view, there is no alternative than to advise those unwilling or unable people always to consistently and correctly use condoms, while at the same tune we should encourage them to change their behaviour.\nOne of the greatest problems to introducing the proposed guidelines is certainly the widespread difficulty there is to talk about sexual matters. This is something that we have to overcome in order to save people from dying, and to lead them into real loving relationships."}

The most difficult problem in setting up LGR of Internet Top-Level Hanja Domain is how to treat Hanja variants. If domains containing variants (e.g.: 東海國) are directed to different addresses, confusion will arise. Therefore, it is desirable that such domains are directed to the same address. Since variant groups of Korea and China are not same, we need to unify variant groups of Korea and China. In the process of reviewing 3093 Chinese variant groups, the author found that Korea does not need to review Chinese variant groups which include no or just one Korean Hanja character. Korea only need to review Chinese variant groups which include two or more Korean Hanja characters.

Mechanical design of an artificial finger is the key factor in determining the performance of a prosthetic hand. To achieve a simple, dexterous and functional bionic hand, researchers have argued that two main requirements should be incorporated in developing an artificial finger: (i) an anthropomorphic structure and (ii) the capability of grasping objects in a stable and secure way. This paper first considers the existing body of literature on the various performance criteria used for prosthetic fingers. These criteria are classified into a) grasp and b) physical characteristics. To this end, various perspectives of existing papers on prosthetic finger's features such as shape-adaptivity, natural motion, stability, force isotropy, workspace, and weight are considered. Furthermore, existing linkage-driven fingers of hand prostheses are reviewed. For this purpose, relevant articles published between 2000 and 2019 were searched, and a total of 28 linkage-driven mechanisms from about 280 papers were selected and assessed based on the performance criteria. Finally, according to the intended use of a prosthetic hand, this paper suggests some key considerations needed for developing an anthropomorphic artificial finger."}

Previous studies have reported that S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2), a subunit of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is engaged in the malignant biological behavior of some tumor entities. However, SKP2 has not been fully investigated in PDAC. In the present study, it was observed that high expression of SKP2 significantly correlates with decreased survival time . Further experiments suggested that SKP2 promotes metastasis by interacting with the putative transcription factor paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1). According to the results of coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays, SKP2 depletion resulted in the polyubiquitination of PSPC1, followed by its degradation. Furthermore, the SKP2-mediated ubiquitination of PSPC1 partially depended on the activity of the E3 ligase TRIM21 . In addition, inhibition of the SKP2/PSPC1 axis by SMIP004, a traditional inhibitor of SKP2, impaired the migration of PDAC cells. In summary, this study provides novel insight into the mechanisms involved in PDAC malignant progression. Targeting the SKP2/PSPC1 axis is a promising strategy for the treatment of PDAC. • SKP2 is a promising prognostic indicator of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. • SKP2 is able to ubiquitinate PSPC1 and promote the metastasis of PDAC cells. • SKP2-mediated ubiquitination of PSPC1 is partially dependent on TRIM21. • SMIP004 impairs PDAC cells migration through inhibiting the SKP2/PSPC1 axis. • Targeting SKP2/PSPC1 axis is an innovative strategy against PDAC."}

Sustainable materials such as laminated wood and bamboo composites are increasingly being used in the construction of green buildings across the world. Such products may be exposed to cyclic environmental conditions and exhibit moisture-induced damage. Predicting the moisture profile variation with time is the first step towards understanding the performance of such products under combined mechanical and environmental loads. The main objective of this study is to develop and validate an efficient, physically-based tool to elucidate the transient moisture transport in layered orthotropic composites made from wood and bamboo. To ensure the capability of the framework in capturing the essential moisture transport mechanisms, a comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine the most critical parameters in moisture transport phenomena in laminated panels. Thermal moisture analogy theory was used for simulating the moisture transport across the composite material cross-section. The analogy approach was first verified based on a simple one-dimensional (1-D) analytical model. Then, moisture profiles in various small laminated composite panels were predicted using a three-dimensional (3-D) finite element model developed in ANSYS Workbench©. Unlike previous studies, the moisture adsorption curve of the material was used instead of employing surface emission coefficient to estimate moisture flux at the surfaces. Results were compared against experimental data for validation purposes. A series of parametric studies were conducted using the validated model to highlight quantitatively the effect of glue line and the constituents’ (i.e. wood/bamboo and adhesive) physical properties on the moisture transport across the composite panel. The model predictions showed a remarkably good description of the data reported in the literature. For the first time, the results showed that the choice of adhesive along with the combination of wood/bamboo physical properties can significantly affect the panel’s moisture profile even after 14 days under similar environmental conditions."}

Following brain injury, glia quickly respond by cleaning up neuronal and synaptic debris. In addition to their role as the cleaning cell of the brain, recent research has shown that during development, glia also shape and fine-tune neural connections by eliminating weak synapses fated for removal. However, whether glial cells also continue to remodel synaptic architecture in the adult brain is unclear. Moreover, synaptic pruning and loss are early hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but whether glial cells play a role in this pathophysiology remains mysterious. We will investigate the role of glial cells in AD-related synaptic loss using a Drosophila melanogaster model of AD. First, we will establish when synaptic loss occurs in AD model flies. Subsequently, we will explore the role of the glial engulfment receptor Draper, which is essential for glial clearance of neuronal debris after injury, and evaluate its effect on synaptic loss in the AD fly model. For these studies, we will use immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques, as well as the power of Drosophila genetics. Through this project, we hope to 1) determine similarities and differences between the Drosophila AD model and human disease, 2) identify glial signals that may contribute to synaptic loss in this model and 3) identify molecular targets, which can potentially be manipulated to prevent or delay the first signs of AD."}

A mixed inflammatory cell response consisting of neutrophils and macrophages occurred at most of the time periods for all the cements examined in the CTI study. Similar cell populations, including lymphocytes, were observed with the PCI study using differential staining techniques. The histopathological observations from both procedures were similar. Each cement elicited a chronic foreign body reaction containing few chronic cells and mature fibroblastic activity. The intensity of the observed tissue reactions for each cement, as determined by capsule thickness in the CTI study and the overall cell counts in the PCI study, did not differ significantly with increasing time. The cellular and connective tissue reactions to the zinc hexyl vanillate (ZHV) cement approximated those of zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) and zinc phosphate (ZP) cements for both methodologies utilized in this work. While similar histopathological results were obtained for the implantation of cements using both methodologies, the PCI technique offers a more thorough investigation of cellular and tissue responses to implanted materials. In addition to histopathological evaluations, the PCI techniques allows quantitative investigation of the specific cells responding to the implants, and provides a mechanism, using chemical analysis techniques, to quantify the concentration of specific degradative products within the retrieved cells and host tissue.

In the present study, glomerular MAPK activities, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), and transcriptional factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1) were examined in glomerular injury of salt-induced hypertensive rats. Six-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-S) and salt-resistant (Dahl-R) rats were maintained on a high-salt (8.0% NaCl) diet for 1, 5, and 10 wk. In Dahl-S rats, as shown by in-gel kinase assay, an increase in BP by a high-salt diet was followed by chronic activation of glomerular ERK and JNK, which continued until 10 wk after a high-salt diet. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the protein expression of glomerular ERK and JNK in Dahl-S rats fed a high-salt diet. As determined by gel-mobility shift assay, ERK and JNK activations were associated with an increase in glomerular AP-1 DNA binding activity. On the other hand, in Dahl-R rats fed a high-salt diet, BP remained normal throughout the experiments. However, glomerular ERK and JNK activities and AP-1 DNA binding activity in Dahl-R rats were not affected by 1 or 5 wk of a high-salt diet, but significantly increased by 10 wk of treatment with a high-salt diet, indicating that chronic sodium overload itself stimulated glomerular ERK and JNK and AP-1 activities. These kinase activations in both Dahl-S and Dahl-R rats were accompanied by an increase in urinary protein excretion and renal growth. These observations provide the first evidence that salt-sensitive hypertension causes chronic activation of glomerular ERK and JNK, probably leading to the activation of AP-1. Thus, glomerular MAPK may be responsible for the development of salt-induced glomerular injury."}

In this study, we investigate the biophysical mechanisms that drive immunological synapse formation in B cells by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Our approach simulates individual reaction and diffusion events on cell surfaces in a probabilistic manner with a clearly defined mapping between our model's probabilistic parameters and their physical equivalents. Our model incorporates the bivalent nature of the BCR as well as changes in membrane shape due to receptor-ligand binding. We find that differences in affinity and bond stiffness between BCR/Ag and LFA-1/ICAM-1 are sufficient to drive synapse formation in the absence of membrane deformation. When significant membrane deformation occurs as a result of receptor-ligand binding, our model predicts the affinity-dependent mechanism needs to be complemented by a BCR signaling-driven shift in LFA-1 affinity from low to high in order for synapses to form."}

It argues that the Council’s persistent dysfunction stems less from its membership structure than from the strategic misuse of veto power by its five permanent members (P5). Through legal interpretation, institutional analysis, and comparative case studies, the paper demonstrates that the veto has evolved from a collective safeguard into a political instrument that obstructs accountability and impedes humanitarian responses. Drawing on Articles 27(3), 31, 34, and 35 of the UN Charter, the study clarifies common misconceptions about membership inclusivity and shows that procedural participation is already available without structural expansion. It critically evaluates the limitations of expanding permanent membership and instead proposes institutional reforms that do not require Charter amendments. These include strengthening General Assembly oversight under Resolution 76/262, establishing a “Veto Accountability Index,” and restricting veto use in mass atrocity contexts. This paper ultimately contends that targeted, non-Charter-based reforms are not only more politically feasible but also essential to restoring the UNSC’s credibility and effectiveness in a rapidly evolving global order."}

Three-dimensional flow and temperature distributions of LBE were simulated using commercial CFD software. The simulation results are firstly compared with the experimental data from the literature. A good agreement demonstrated the capability of the employed approach to predict the flow and temperature field in the rod bundle. Consequently, the influence from mass flow rate on the inter-channel mixing caused by the wire-wrapped spacer was investigated. The cross flow between sub-channels through gap has been evaluated as well as its induced temperature variance over the rod surface.

Data acquisition systems used for petroleum exploration record 96 or more channels in a linear array, and thus obtain a virtually unaliased representation of the wavefield. The data contains reflections from all angles of incidence, including postcritical angles, all normal modes, leaky modes, and head waves. A key tool in dealing with this kind of data is the Radon transform, which transforms the data set into a plane‐wave representation. A raw data set u(x,t) is transformed into v(p,τ), where p, which parameterizes the plane waves, is the x component of slowness, and τ is a reduced (intercept) time. The ensemble of plane‐wave seismograms is the basis for inversion of the data to obtain a one‐dimensional velocity/impedance model. Modeling the lossy elastic transient plane‐wave response is easily done by one of the modifications of the Thomson‐Haskell matrix method. The algorithm can be vectorized to run very rapidly on a machine with an array processor. The object of the inversion is to obtain a model whose plane‐wave decomposition agrees exactly with that of the observed wavefield. In the absence of noise, one plane‐wave seismogram suffices to determine the model. An ensemble for a range of wave parameters overdetermines the model. In the presence of noise, the problem has the character of an ill‐posed, overdetermined least squares problem. In order to carry through the solution by means of least squares, it is necessary to go through a construction procedure to make the trial model linearly close to the correct one in some parameter subspace. Several construction procedures proceed by stripping from the top down, although none have been reduced to a fully automatic alogrithm, and require some human intervention in the iterations."}

With the flourishing of Cape No.7 which is released in 2008, Taiwanese films have started reaching international audiences, and the subtitles between multi-linguistic Taiwanese and English have thus become particularly important. In Taiwan, the multilingualism can no longer be ignored. The code-mixing, colloquialism, idioms, cultural-related puns and pop-songs pose the challenge to audiovisual translators, along with certain restrictions which operate in subtitling. \nTaking Seven Days in Heaven (父後七日) as a case study, this paper will examine the effects of English subtitles on Taiwanese film, and discuss the difficulties associated with culture-related untranslatability in translation. Because of the time and space, subtitle translation is a triggering problem (Díaz, 2007; Egoyan & Balfour, 2004 ; Gambier, 1997; Gottlieb, 1994 ; Yang, 2008). In order to grasp the insight of audio-visual translation, the data of the specifically-designed questionnaire, completed by 210 students from I-Shou University in Taiwan, will be analyzed, and with the support of translation theories, particular translation strategies will be provided. The translation of subtitle attempts inevitably to bridge the cultural and linguistic gaps. Seeing from this perspective, translation theories and views, such as domestification and foreignization, equivalence, interlinguistic translation, semiotics, polysystem, and descriptive translation, will be further explored, while searching for the solutions to subtitle translation with the cultural bound topics.  The purpose of this study is to investigate how English subtitles cater the need of the minority language - Taiwanese. According to Venuti’s (1995) translation theory, it is essential to make a decision of applying domestification or foreignization to help the audience comprehend the movie immediately. Is subtitle translation the continuing life of the movie as Benjamin (1923) proposed? Moreover, which strategy can fulfill the communicative function? And to which level? The issues of rewriting, invisibility of the subtitlers and the continuing life of the source text will be discussed to support our strategic process, designed on purpose for catching the spirit of subtitle translation and for fulfilling its semantic and cultural functions."}

Richard Nixon’s and Henry Kissinger’s priority was international stability provided by the understanding between the USA and the Soviet Union, whereas Willy Brandt’s dynamic détente approach was aimed at Europe’s transformation overcoming the Iron Curtain. In Nixon’s and Kissinger’s balance of power policy, stability was essential to cement what they perceived as an endangered status quo in Europe. Brandt and his foreign policy advisor Egon Bahr saw détente as a way to facilitate liberalizing changes. They envisaged stability in international relations a precondition to guarantee the regimes behind the Iron Curtain the kind of security that would over time allow them to open up their societies for Western influence. Finally, the overlaps between both approaches prevailed. Examining Kissinger’s initial doubts over Ostpolitik’s feasibility, the essay depicts his way to control the détente process in Europe through the Quadripartite negotiations over Berlin in 1971. Eventually, Ostpolitik’s success was a catalyst and a prerequisite for Richard Nixon’s and Henry Kissinger’s own approach to the Soviet Union despite the escalation of the Vietnam War."}

However, responses of trees to minor and local damage imposed by small arthropod herbivores, especially by those mining or skeletonising individual leaves, remain poorly understood. We studied the delayed effects of injuries by several leafmining and leafrolling insects on the performance of downy birch shoots. Insect feeding did not affect survival of shoots or survival of individual axillary buds in long shoots. In the year following the damage, shoots produced an average of 13.8% more biomass than undamaged shoots of the same tree. The magnitude of this effect increased with an increase in the leaf area injured during the previous year, but it did not differ among four localities in subarctic and boreo-nemoral forests, between herbivore feeding guilds, or among herbivores imposing damage in early, mid and late summer. We also found that herbivores attacked the next-year foliage produced by damaged shoots less frequently than they attacked the next-year foliage produced by undamaged shoots of the same tree. Thus, our study demonstrated delayed local compensatory growth and increased antiherbivore defence in downy birch shoots following local damage by insect feeding. We suggest that this pattern reflects evolutionary adaptations of plants to permanently acting minor, dispersed and spatially unpredictable damage imposed by endemic herbivory. Local responses are less costly and represent a more sustainable strategy to maintain plant fitness under low levels of herbivory than constitutive resistance or systemic responses."}

Reversal of antibiotic resistance in Gram-positive bacteria by the antihistaminic azelastine. APMIS 2012; 120: 215–20.\nAntibiotic resistance represents a serious problem that complicates microbial infection. The use of ‘helper compounds’ capable of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics is being investigated. Azelastine, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. Hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. Azelastine significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (β-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine Gram-positive clinical isolates: five Staphylococcus aureus, two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two Enterococcus faecium, seven of which were multi-drug resistant, reversing their resistance to the tested antibiotics. The synergistic effects of azelastine with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the pH from 5 to 8. Antibiotics did not affect the ability of azelastine to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. The findings of this study present azelastine as a potential ‘helper compound’ that could reverse the resistance of multi-drug resistant Gram-positive clinical isolates to antibiotics."}

Chain shuffling has been successfully used to humanize murine antibody fragments and also to obtain affinity matured variants. Here we report a different application of this method: the use of chain shuffling to overcome improper prokaryotic expression behavior of a hybridoma-derived single-chain antibody fragment. Construction and expression of such recombinant antibody fragments remain as empirical entities, hampered by the inability to express some antibody genes coming from eukaryotic cells in bacterial expression systems . Such problems are different for each combination of variable regions and can be serious enough to preclude the use of some hybridomas as sources of V regions to obtain recombinant antibody fragments. The particular binding properties and potential usefulness of some monoclonal antibodies make it highly desirable to bypass these technical limitations in order to develop smaller size therapeutic agents in the form of antibody fragments. The 14F7 mouse monoclonal antibody is one such attractive candidate due to its high specificity for the N -glycolyl GM3 ganglioside overexpressed in tumor cells and its ability to distinguish this antigen from closely related gangliosides like N -acetyl GM3. Our goal was to construct a phage-displayed single-chain Fv antibody fragment derived from 14F7. After cloning the original variable regions from the 14F7 hybridoma in a phagemid vector, we were unable to detect either binding activity or even expression of antibody fragments in bacteria, despite repetitive efforts. We constructed light-chain shuffling libraries, from which functional antibody fragments were readily selected. These combined the original 14F7 heavy chain variable region with a wide variety of unrelated murine and human light-chain variable regions. New antibody fragments retained the valuable properties of the monoclonal antibody in terms of fine specificity, affinity and tumor recognition. They were readily produced by bacteria, either in phage-displayed form or as soluble molecules, and provided a panel of potentially useful variants for cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy . Chain shuffling and phage display were found to be useful strategies for selecting antibody fragments on the basis of both prokaryotic expression and antigen binding criteria."}

In order to speak freely about love – either sentimental or sexual – and to counter the effects of censorship, novelists soon started to develop more sophisticated narrative and enunciative strategies, allowing them to deny authorial responsibility while leaving textual traces which the reader could track down.

Studies about gender and mobile phones can be divided into two categories: studies centred on the differences between men and women, and those that offer a more nuanced account of gender practices. The stories of women presented in the chapter illustrate the multiplicity of the facets of their emerging relationship with mobile phones, and how their life stories intersect with different uses of technology and the mobile phone in particular.

The first section is devoted to the nature of science and God. Whereas Gregory thinks science is based on metaphysical naturalism with a methodological corollary of critical-realist empiricism, I see critical, empiricist methodology as basic, and naturalism as a consequence. Gregory's exposition of his apophatic theology, in which univocity is eschewed, illustrates the fissure between religious and scientific worldviews—no matter which basic scientific theory one subscribes to. The second section is allotted to miracles. As I do, Gregory thinks no miracle occurred on Fox Lakes in 1652, but he restricts himself to understanding the actors and explaining change over time, and refuses to explain past or contemporary actions and events. Marc Bloch, in his book The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France, is willing to go much further than Gregory. Using his superior medical knowledge to substitute his own explanation of the phenomenon for that of the actors, Bloch dismisses the actors’ beliefs that they or others had been miraculously cured, and explains that they believed they saw miraculous healing because they were expecting to see it. In the third section, on historical explanation, I rephrase the question whether historians can accommodate both believers in God and naturalist scientists, asking whether God, acting miraculously or not, can be part of the ideal explanatory text. I reply in the negative, and explicate how the concept of a plural subject suggests how scientists can also be believers. This approach may be compatible with two options presented by Peter Lipton for resolving the tension between religion and science. The first is to see the truth claims of religious texts as untranslatable into scientific language (and vice versa); the other is to immerse oneself in religious texts by accepting them as a guide but not believing in their truth claims when these contradict science."}

The use of a partial evaluation scheme is crucial to the theory and the most prominent schemes that are adopted are the strong Kleene and the supervaluation scheme. The strong Kleene scheme is attractive because it ensures the compositionality of the notion of truth. But under the strong Kleene scheme classical tautologies do not, in general, turn out to be true and, as a consequence, classical reasoning is no longer admissible once the notion of truth is involved. The supervaluation scheme adheres to classical reasoning but violates compositionality. Moreover, it turns Kripke’s theory into a rather complicated affair: to check whether a sentence is true we have to look at all admissible precisification of the interpretation of the truth predicate we are presented with. One consequence of this complicated evaluation condition is that under the supervaluation scheme a more proof-theoretic characterization of Kripke’s theory becomes inherently difficult, if not impossible. In this paper we explore the middle ground between the strong Kleene and the supervaluation scheme and provide an evaluation scheme that adheres to classical reasoning but retains many of the attractive features of the strong Kleene scheme. We supplement our semantic investigation with a novel axiomatic theory of truth that matches the semantic theory we have put forth."}

The static features such as color and size of the bubbles and the dynamic features such as velocity have obvious differences between different working conditions. The extraction of these features is typically relied on the outcomes of image segmentation at the froth edge, making the segmentation of froth image the basis for studying its visual information. Meanwhile, the absence of scientifically reliable training data with label and the necessity to manually construct dataset and label make the study difficult in the mineral flotation. To solve this problem, this paper constructs a tungsten concentrate froth image dataset, and proposes a data augmentation network based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (cGAN) and a U-Net++-based edge segmentation network. The performance of this algorithm is also evaluated and contrasted with other algorithms in this paper. On the results of semantic segmentation, a phase-correlation-based velocity extraction method is finally suggested."}

It argues for the need to revise the Constitution of the United States in reference to the cutting-edge human rights norms that find expression not only in the classics of the human rights canon.

This emphasizes the relevance of PA in diabetes prevention lifestyle intervention initiatives and encourages healthcare practitioners to advise high-risk patients on a healthy lifestyle combining PA for the reduction of weight in prediabetic, obese, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. The link between PA and diabetes was stronger in people with moderate or higher baseline PA, reflecting national recommendations that imply increasing activity levels may provide larger advantages for those who are comparatively less active.\r\n\r\nAn intensive lifestyle intervention of eating healthier foods and increasing PA resulted in an effective decrease in weight and waist circumference after one year, which has high potential in the long term to prevent T2DM and different comorbidities such as obesity. Studies such as PRomotion Of Physical activity through structured Education with differing Levels of ongoing Support for those with prediabetes (PROPELS) demonstrate that the combination of PA interventions with telemedicine follow-ups results in ambulatory activity changes in the first year, but these changes do not last longer than four years. Acute PA practicing regularly will reduce postprandial glucose excursions. However, it is unknown what type of PA routine will benefit the most from reducing postprandial glucose levels. There are no discernible variations in the effects of different disciplines of training on glucose levels, mainly when the data are compared across time. The combination of a healthy diet and lifestyle with programs based on diabetes prevention results in comparable and clinically significant mean weight reduction with cardiometabolic advantages. Based on the reviewed and cited studies, PA in patients at high risk of T2DM and obese and non-obese patients with T2DM results in favorable outcomes in the first few months. There is a large gap in investigations of the effects of PA in these patients and the benefits of other lifestyle modifications in long-term-based studies. However, in this study, we emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications, putting in perspective principally the PA that the majority of patients with comorbidities do not practice, especially those with obesity, prediabetes, and T2DM.

The mural scenes at San Bartolo bring to mind elements of the Codex Fejervary-Mayer as well as the Codex Borgia. In all cases, divine sacrifice is associated with the establishment of an orderly world. In this manner and through sacrifice, we see the order of the cosmos to the East, West, North and South; but also a paradise created, the underworld, the earth and the sky; and also a cosmos of flowers, aquatic, animal and of birds. Likewise, the mural artistic narrative, as well as its own composition, serves to establishing parallels between the divine action and the royal one, reinforcing the connection between the center of the world, civilization, maize and the king. All of this was used in San Bartolo to legitimize a historic king, linking his rightfulness to his direct association with the divine instead of ancestry."}

Method:  This study is a quasi-experimental study with pretest-posttest control group design. The control group received counseling about the field of public health sciences, whereas the intervention group receive the same counseling accompanied by a description of the activity-based cost and opportunity cost in the field of public health sciences. The study population was 216 students of medical faculty batch 2014. Out of 216 students, 70 met the inclusion criteria, and only 36 who came to the activity. Data analysis was performed using paired t-test.     Results:  Thirty-six students came to the medical career day activities are divided into 2 groups: the first 18 people who come into the intervention group and 18 others to a control group. Increased interest in the control group (p=0.003) and increased interest in the intervention group was also significant (p=0.023).

Gradients in these two fields are the driving forces that move the immiscible fluids around. The fluids are characterized by two seepage velocity fields, one for each fluid. Following Hansen et al. (Transport in Porous Media, 125, 565 (2018)), we construct a two-way transformation between the velocity couple consisting of the seepage velocity of each fluid, to a velocity couple consisting of the average seepage velocity of both fluids and a new velocity parameter, the co-moving velocity. The co-moving velocity is related but not equal to velocity difference between the two immiscible fluids. The two-way mapping, the mass conservation equation and the constitutive equations for the average seepage velocity and the co-moving velocity form a closed set of equations that determine the flow. There is growing experimental, computational and theoretical evidence that constitutive equation for the average seepage velocity has the form of a power law in the pressure gradient over a wide range of capillary numbers. Through the transformation between the two velocity couples, this constitutive equation may be taken directly into account in the equations describing the flow of each fluid. This is, e.g., not possible using relative permeability theory. By reverse engineering relative permeability data from the literature, we construct the constitutive equation for the co-moving velocity. We also calculate the co-moving constitutive equation using a dynamic pore network model over a wide range of parameters, from where the flow is viscosity dominated to where the capillary and viscous forces compete. Both the relative permeability data from the literature and the dynamic pore network model give the same very simple functional form for the constitutive equation over the whole range of parameters."}

After flowering, the plants were treated by selectively removing leaflets and pods from the two branches. One-third of the leaflets and one-third of the pods were removed from each of the branches of plants subjected to the even treatment whereas two-thirds of the leaflets from one branch and two-thirds of the pods from the other branch were removed in the uneven treatment. The photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area and the rate of growth of the pods were similar for all branches. Since the leaf area of one branch was three times the leaf area of the other branch in the uneven treatment, long distance translocation from one branch to the other was necessary to support the growth of the seeds. The rate of abortion of the seeds appeared to be much less on the branches having fewer pods in the uneven treatment. The final yield (g/m2) for each of the individual branches of both treatments was the same, indicating that the uptake of carbohydrate by the seeds was not limited by resistance to long distance translocation."}

The current College of American Pathologists clinical laboratory standard states that a urine sample cultured with more than two isolates with >10,000 colony forming units/ml is to be considered contaminated. However, the presence of urinary sample bacteria in individuals without urinary symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria) is common especially in older people and in pregnant individuals. Furthermore, the discovery of an indigenous urinary microbiome (urobiome) in healthy humans throughout life from shortly after birth to death conflicts with the long-standing notion that urine derived from sterile filtered blood should be sterile above the urethral sphincter. Polymicrobial infections clash with Koch’s postulates that a single pathogen is causal for disease. In this review, we will discuss current standards of contamination, how to reconcile the sterility of urine with the existence of the urobiome, a history of polymicrobial infections, and why re-examining current practices is essential for the practice of medicine, improving quality of life, and potentially saving lives."}

In order to assist Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and researchers to make more informed risk/benefit analyses with regard to sex research among adolescents, the current study examined the effects of participation in sex research among 899 young people (15–25 years old). Participants completed three questionnaires on a wide range of sexuality-related measures. They also completed scales measuring their levels of distress, need for help, and positive feelings due to their research participation. In general, negative effects of research participation seemed limited, while benefits of participation appeared substantial. Several differences with regard to sociodemographic characteristics were found (e.g., females experienced more distress then males and younger or lower educated participants experienced more positive feelings). In addition, victims of sexual coercion reported more distress and need for help due to their participation, but also experienced more positive feelings. No significant differences were found in relation to experience with sexual risk behaviors (e.g., experience with one-night-stands). Several limitations of the study were discussed, as were implications for future research. Overall, the findings caution IRBs and researchers against being overly protective regarding the inclusion of young people in sex research."}

Liver being a vital organ performs more than hundreds regulatory functions of the body. Present study investigates the modulation of molecular pathways that are responsible for liver damage triggered by heat stress. Male Sprague dawley rats were exposed to heat stress (45 °C) in heat simulation chamber till core temperature reaches 40 °C and 42 °C in 25 and 42 min respectively. For in-depth evaluation of liver functions during severe heat stress, hepatic transcriptome and proteome were analysed by microarray and two dimensional gel electrophoresis respectively. Results revealed major alterations in redox status, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis related pathways. Data of molecular pathway analysis demonstrate that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) mediated oxidative stress response and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) regulated inflammatory pathways were upregulated in severe heat stressed liver. Expression levels of downstream molecules of above pathways such as heat shock protein 90AB 1, peroxiredoxin 5, Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2, heme-oxygenase 1, apolipoprotein 1 and interleukin 10 were examined and result suggested the upregulation of these genes modulates the NRF-2 and MIF regulated pathways in heat stressed liver. Irregularity in molecular signalling networks lead to mitochondrial dysfunction indicated by upregulation of ATP synthase β and peroxiredoxin 1 along with decreased levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and enhanced activity of cytochrome c in liver mitochondria. Thus, current study demonstrated heat induced alterations in key liver functions were regulated by NRF-2 and MIF pathways."}

We also investigated the influence of diet and physical activity on bone mass. The study group included 51 male and 75 female students aged 19 to 25 years. Bone mineral density was measured for the spine, total femur, and the distal third of the radius using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary data were obtained using a specially designed semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD; g cm-2) was higher in boys than in girls at all measured sites, while bone mineral apparent density (BMAD; g cm-3) was higher in girls. Age negatively correlated with bone mineral density in all measured sites except in the boys' spine. Sodium, protein, and fibres were nutrients that significantly correlated with bone mineral density. The study suggests that boys achieve peak bone density later than girls, and that this delay is the most prominent in the spine. In our study group,"}

Ageratum conyzoides L. (Asteraceae) is an aromatic, annual herb and cosmopolitan weed commonly known as billygoat weed or goat weed and is typically found in cultivated fields and other disturbed ecosystems. The species has been studied widely owing to its biological properties and its potential application in medicine and agriculture. Due to its importance and use in the treatment of burns and wounds, arthrosis, malaria, asthma, leprosy and dermatitis, its medicinal properties have been reviewed. A. conyzoides , however, also has insecticidal activity against a range of major pests of field crops and stored products including Callosobruchus chinensis L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Chilo partellus Swinhoe (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), Sitophilus oryzae L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Panonychus citri McGregor (Tetranychidae: Panonychus), Sitophilus zeamais Motchulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) , Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) and Brevicoryne brassicae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Evidence suggests that its efficacy is comparable to synthetic pesticides and that it is economically viable too while its impact on beneficial insects including ladybirds, hoverflies and spiders is much reduced compared to synthetics. Anti-microbial activity against important agricultural disease agents is also reviewed here including against Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl., (Hypochreales: Nectriaceae), Phytophthora citrophthora (R.E.

These activities suggest a compelling multipurpose plant that has merit as a potential commercial species. Since earlier reviews have focused on medicinal properties of A. conyzoides and less on its potential value in agriculture, this review seeks to bridge this gap by reviewing research on the various properties of this species that are relevant to food production. The review presents updated information on the use of this species as an agricultural resource and emphasizes its potential as an industrial crop."}

Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) causes ovulation to occur in rabbits approximately 10 hr after injection. When mating was delayed at least 6 hr, 13% of the blastocysts were found to be triploid. Triploidy was not found in the control series, although blastocysts from animals mated immediately after hcg injection had a 7% incidence of other types of chromosomal anomalies. Rabbits receiving no exogenous gonadotrophin gave rise to only 2% of blastocysts with abnormal chromosomes. This difference led to an experiment in which various doses of hcg were injected before mating in order to determine whether a relationship existed between the dose level and the chromosomal abnormalities found in 6-day blastocysts. Adult rabbits of mixed breeds purchased from a local supplier were used. Eleven rabbits were"}

At least two populations of Leydig cells differentiate sequentially as the testis develops—a fetal population which regulates masculinization in utero and an adult population which develops before puberty and regulates adult fertility and sex drive. A third, neonatal population is also observed in the human which may represent re-activation of the fetal Leydig cells. The fetal Leydig cells in the human depend upon stimulation by chorionic gonadotropin and produce androgens through the canonical steroidogenic pathway and also, possibly, through an alternative “backdoor” pathway; both pathways apparently being required for normal fetal masculinization. Fetal Leydig cells also secrete insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3) which, along with androgen, induces testicular descent. The fetal Leydig cell population persists into adulthood in mice but becomes secondary to the adult population. Development of the adult Leydig cell population is dependent on the Sertoli cells and on luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary. The adult cells in humans secrete mainly testosterone synthesized through the Δ5 canonical pathway, and cell activity is dependent on LH and the bone-derived hormone osteocalcin while the Sertoli cells, through unknown factors, act to maintain Leydig cell numbers. During aging in humans, there is a reduction in Leydig cell activity and, possibly, Leydig cell numbers. Leydig cell tumors are rare but will lead to precocious puberty when they occur in prepubertal boys. In about half of cases these tumors are associated with activating mutations in the steroidogenic machinery [e.g., the luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR)]."}

In both cases, U.S. government efforts to ensure compliance with the International Whaling Commission (IWC) decisions were central to the outcome. Yet no government's choices can be understood without examining how decision makers were influenced by three nongovernmental groups—an economic interest group of whaling industry managers, an expert epistemic community of cetologists, and an issue-oriented lobbying coalition of environmentalists—which vied for influence nationally and transnationally. The epistemic community of cetologists shaped particular policy choices only in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Earlier, it was eclipsed by the industry managers and, later, by the environmentalists. However, it had sufficient continuing influence to limit the range of policy options and thereby prevent the adoption of the most consumptionist alternatives in the 1940s and 1950s and of the most preservationist ones in recent years."}

The H monomer was reacted with G and a 1:1 molar mixture of S:G monomers at H molar compositions of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mol% to study how the presence of the H monomer affected the structure and composition of the recovered polymers. At low H concentrations, solid-state NMR spectra suggest that the H and G monomers interact to form G:H polymers that have a lower average molecular weight than the solely G-based polymer or the G:H polymer produced at higher H concentrations. Solid-state NMR and pyrolysis–MBMS analyses suggest that at higher H concentrations, the H monomer primarily self-polymerizes to produce clusters of H-based polymer that are segregated from clusters of G- or S:G-based polymers. Thioacidolysis generally showed higher recoveries of thioethylated products from S:G or S:G:H polymers made with higher H content, indicating an increase in the linear ether linkages.

This thesis explores how augmented reality (AR) technology can turn traditional storytelling into an exciting and educational experience to help children learn about climate change. Sam and Mia’s Earth-Saving Adventure, a 10-page graphic storybook enhanced with AR, allows children aged 3-10 to interact with the story through animations and sound effects that respond to their choices. Developed using Adobe Aero, the book creates an immersive and fun way for children to engage with environmental topics.\nThe study uses a combination of methods: ethnographic observations capture children's engagement during AR interactions, and their performance in a quiz is quantitatively analyzed to measure comprehension and retention. Findings reveal that AR-infused storytelling not only captivates young learners but also deepens their understanding of climate concepts. Children demonstrated excitement and curiosity, with many showing improved recall and the ability to link the story’s lessons to real-world environmental actions.\nBy combining immersive technology with playful education, this study provides insights into innovative approaches for early childhood learning, emphasizing the potential of AR to inspire a generation of environmentally conscious individuals."}

Cometabolic biotransformation of both mono- and polychlorinated CHCs by novel biocatalyst composites harnessing single strain microorganism was demonstrated for two sites requiring ex situ bioremediation of groundwater. Batch testing with propane-induced biocatalyst revealed rapid degradation of several CHCs, including 1,2,3-trichloropropane (TCP) to low parts per billion levels. Continuous-flow treatment of synthetic groundwater containing nine CHCs revealed biocatalyst consistently degraded trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane to below the target 50 μg/L concentration, along with equimolar chloride formation (within 10 % of theoretical stoichiometric yield). These results highlight the efficacy of a novel biocatalyst process utilizing a single strain of microorganism for aerobic ex situ bioremediation of mono- and polychlorinated CHCs including TCP. • Novel microbial biocatalysts enable simultaneous aerobic cometabolism of multiple CHCs. • Trichloropropane degradation fit first order decay with rate constant k  = 0.57 h −1 . • Continuous lab-scale bioreactors mimic ex situ biological treatment of complex CHC mixture. • Evidence for full mineralization of CHCs with full recovery of chloride ion • Bioremediation harnessing single strain organism within polymeric composites"}

The present investigation reviews these different monitoring approaches to highlight whether synergies between them could be developed into an integrated approach to marine benthic monitoring. An integrated approach would have ecological benefits, as greater consistency in sampling and analytical protocols would reduce uncertainty in the predictions of impact, and facilitate the assessment of Good Environmental Status under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The same approach would also be of financial benefit, as spatio-temporal duplication in sampling would be reduced, and the value of acquired data would be maximised, resulting in a more efficient and cost-effective approach. • Integrated benthic monitoring is proposed across offshore industries and government. • An approach has been devised based on an existing regional seabed monitoring plan. • Integration would deliver a coherent dataset for assessments under the MSFD. • The approach would result in an efficient and cost-effective national monitoring programme."}

Refusing the interpretation of racial laws as a temporary phase of Italian history completely alien to the country’s cultural context, the article underlines how 1938 fits into and can be reinserted into the general interpretation of the Institute of Roman Studies’ initiatives. Furthermore, it analyses the consequences of the racial legislation on the staff and collaborators employed by the Institute. The author shows that the racial laws represent an additional element of the attempt of some distinguished intellectuals to find a synthesis between the sacralisation of politics and the politicisation of religion through the myth of Rome. Spreading and trying to strengthen the national-roman version of racism, the author underlines that the Institute of Roman Studies was in the first line to shaping an interpretation that, influenced by the Catholic anti-modern thought, was no more moderate or less responsible for the persecution of the Jews than other more revolutionary positions inside the fascism. In fact, this interpretation made the concept of the Italian race even more acceptable in public opinion, strengthening and rooting it in the history and greatness of Italian civilisation throughout the centuries. Finally, the article stresses that the racial laws were a crucial moment of shaping the fascist anthropological revolution, totally supported by an Institute fully engaged in the middle of the battle for the nationalization of the masses fought by the regime and the Catholic Church between the wars"}

Entsprechend umfangreich sind die Untersuchungen allein in den Sozialwissenschaften: Es werden soziale Bedingungen in den Blick genommen, die ein Durchsetzen von Neuerungen auf der gesellschaftlichen Ebene fördern (vgl. Braun-Thürmann 2005). Auf der Ebene von Organisationen blicken Arbeits- und Industriesoziologen auf die nicht-technischen und sozialorganisatorischen Erfolgsfaktoren von Innovationsprozessen (vgl. Moldaschl 2005) sowie auf die damit verbundenen Paradoxien (Sauer/Lang 1999). Zunehmend geraten auch gesellschaftliche Bedarfe und Herausforderungen als mögliche Innovationsquelle für Unternehmen in den Fokus. Trotz der sehr ausführlichen Diskussionen rund um das Thema Innovation ist eine Frage bisher noch nicht systematisch aufgearbeitet (vgl. Blättel-Mink 2006; Moldaschl 2007, 2007a): Wie arbeiten Menschen, wenn sie innovatorisch tätig sind, welche Ambivalenzen und Herausforderungen bewältigen sie in ihrer täglichen Arbeit?

The sliding approach was compared against four controllers: a linear feedback controller, a state-space feedback controller, a proportional controller, and a proportional–integral controller. The evaluation of accuracy and precision with respect to the input reference model showed similar performances across the controllers. However, the sliding approach proved superior when inputting nonlinear reference and discontinuous external perturbations, producing chattering metric errors averaging 0.94 m and mean = 0.012 m, for x y components, respectively A Lyapunov analysis confirmed the sliding mode controller stability during path tracking nonlinear dynamics, handling unpredictable operational conditions. Numerical simulations validated the controller’s effectiveness, showcasing its robustness against external disturbances and its ability to maintain stability and precision during operation. • A kinematic model encompasses different rolling structures in the planner-controller. • A double spiraliform tracks planning method is able to scale, rotate and translate. • A sliding mode controller showed higher nonlinear performance than other controllers. • The controller showed robustness and stability during operation under disturbances. • Path tracking stability control is met under nonlinear unpredictable disturbances."}

The aim of this study was to develop a fully automated image updating system to address brain shift at the start of open cranial surgery and to evaluate its accuracy and efficiency. METHODS This study included patients undergoing open cranial procedures at a single center. Intraoperative stereovision (iSV) images of the surgical field were acquired as an easily integrated nondisruptive source of high-resolution image data on surgical surface deformation and were integrated with a computational model to compensate for volumetric brain shift after dural opening by updating the coregistered preoperative images. A Fast Segment Anything Model algorithm segmented the exposed cortical surface on iSV images automatically. Vessel and sulcus features were also segmented automatically from both iSV and pMR images and registered using a two-step registration method. Extracted nonrigid cortical displacements were assimilated by a finite element model to estimate whole-brain deformation. Updated MR (uMR) images were generated by deforming pMR by the resulting displacement field. A tracked stylus sampled the exposed cortical surface to provide independent measurements for error assessments. The uMR images were evaluated in terms of the misfit between model estimates and measured displacements, target registration error (TRE), and point-to-surface distance (PSD) relative to their pMR counterparts. RESULTS Fifteen patients (age range 45–85 years) who underwent open cranial procedures were included in the study. The overall accuracy of reconstructed iSV surfaces relative to stylus positions was 0.8 ± 0.7 mm. The overall mean misfit, TRE, and PSD of uMR images were 2.1 ± 1.2 mm, 1.9 ± 1.0 mm, and 1.6 ± 1.0 mm, respectively, compared with 6.5 ± 1.3 mm, 6.2 ± 1.2 mm, and 4.5 ± 1.2 mm for pMR images. Image updating was completed automatically without any user intervention in an overall mean of 3.9 ± 0.6 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Automatic image updating compensated for brain shift due to dural opening and achieved clinically acceptable accuracy and efficiency. The system required no user intervention or expertise and caused minimal interruptions to surgical flow, suggesting it has potential for future integration into open cranial procedures."}

Few would disagree that urbanisation can act as a non-specific stressor leading to mental illness in vulnerable individuals, but there is little evidence that the relation is causal. Rather, urbanisation acts through disruption of traditional social organisation and the greater marginalisation of urban than rural poor.\nAlthough it is unrealistic to believe that psychiatry can affect the irresistible force of social and economic change, it does have a role at the level of the individual. By providing an understanding of the neurobiology of stress, biological psychiatry offers insights into the aetiology of psychiatric symptoms and illness, and their treatment. This approach explains why individuals have different susceptibilities to stress with only a few people affected by psychiatric morbidity.\nUltimately there is no schism between biological psychiatry and other approaches; they are no more divided than, for example, the epidemiologist's and pathologist's view of heart disease, for the difference is one of perspective. To focus on this debate is to obscure the real issues that affect the provision of health care in developing countries. Rapidly growing populations, stagnating economies, depressed primary product prices, and debt limit the resources available for health-care provision. It is the failure to address these issues that leads to an “inescapably bleak” future, not only for psychiatry but for medical care as a whole in the developing world."}

In this context, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach has been proposed as a “common ground” in joint HTAs. However, GRADE has been primarily developed to support authors of clinical guidelines. Therefore, it is unclear whether HTA reports based on GRADE are compatible with the methods currently applied by European HTA organizations.MethodsWe contrasted IQWiG's methods paper and publications by the GRADE Working Group with regard to the following domains: 1) risk of bias (RoB) assessment 2) prerequisites for “greater benefit” (assuming that IQWiG's “greater benefit” corresponds to a GRADE assessment of at least low certainty and a small important effect) and 3) consideration of non-randomized studies (NRS). We present illustrative differences and highlight similarities.ResultsOverall, RoB assessments are very similar under both approaches. However, we identified several important differences. In case of very severe publication bias, IQWiG methods preclude drawing a conclusion, whereas GRADE requires only downgrading the certainty of evidence while still allowing for a conclusion on effect sizes. Secondly, IQWiG generally requires a statistically significant effect for a “greater benefit”, while GRADE does not (statistically non-significant effects would only necessitate downgrading the certainty of results for imprecision). Another difference is that in general, NRS are not included in IQWiG assessments when randomized studies (RS) are available and thus possible. In contrast, preliminary GRADE guidance recommends considering NRS in addition to RS when the RS evidence is of low or very low certainty.ConclusionsWhile GRADE and IQWiG's method share some similarities, our exemplary analysis shows that there are some notable differences. Therefore, GRADE should not be used “out of the box” for European HTAs. To foster further discussion, more research (including a comprehensive comparison of methods and an analysis of resources for adaptation) is needed."}

National organizations have recommended curricular and institutional climate changes to address this problem. This study examined students’ perceived attitudes and knowledge regarding LGBT patient care and campus climate at four Midwestern US allopathic medical schools. During 2013, all medical students at the four institutions were invited to participate in the online anonymous survey. We used descriptive statistics for survey item results and qualitative methods to analyze responses to open-ended questions about curricular changes. Survey results were obtained from 34.6% of students and demonstrated that attitudes, knowledge, preparedness, and campus climate across all institutions were generally positive for LGBT patients and students. A negative correlation was found between overall campus climate and discrimination practices. Four themes emerged from students’ recommendations to improve their training, which included more clinical experiences with LGBT patients, more formal curricula on LGBT topics, establishment of safe learning environments, and addition of specific topics related to LGBT health. Due to the low prevalence of LGBT populations, reluctance to disclose sexual orientation or gender identity, and lack of LGBT-specific clinics, required experiences with LGBT patients during clinics or clerkship rotations may be more difficult in smaller urban communities in which some Midwestern medical schools are located. Potential alternatives include using multiple teaching modalities in the pre-clerkship years to expose students to LGBT-identified patients in clinical simulations and settings."}

Both notions are explored by the writer and demonstrate that they can provide insights into significant dimensions of the underpinnings of fonua.

A Heat pipe reactor utilizes heat pipes to transfer fission heat from the reactor core, providing a high level of passive safety and thus representing a promising application for micro-reactors. The startup process of a heat pipe reactor is characterized by a wide range of temperature variations and a dominant expansion reactivity feedback, while also necessitating consideration of the startup issues of the frozen alkali metal heat pipes, which adds significant complexity. To analyze the characteristics of the startup process of the heat pipe reactor, this study couples the MOOSE framework with the two-dimensional high-temperature heat pipe numerical simulation code KMC-HPs, to conduct a high-precision multi-physics coupling simulation study of the nuclear-thermal–mechanical dynamics, and the accuracy and feasibility of this coupling method were validated through simulations of the ground prototype reactor KRUSTY. The analysis indicates that the heat transfer characteristics during the startup process of the heat pipes determine the temperature distribution within the reactor core. Initially, the heat transfer capability of the heat pipes is limited, resulting in a significant temperature difference. However, as the temperature rises and continuous vapor flow occurs in the evaporation section of the heat pipes, the heat transfer capability improves, leading to a more uniform temperature increase across the core with a smaller temperature difference. Mechanical analysis reveals that large thermal stresses occur at the edges of the contact surfaces between the heat pipes and the core, although these stresses remain well below the material’s yield limits. This paper elucidates the multi-physical characteristics of the heat pipe reactor startup process from a numerical simulation perspective, and the developed coupling framework provides high-precision validation for the conceptual design of heat pipe reactors."}

Sedimentation velocity experiments of titrated stoichiometry ratios of β-neurexin and neuroligin suggested a 2:2 complex formation. The recognition properties of individual neuroligins toward β-neurexin-1 (NX1β), along with the influence of their splice inserts, were explored by surface plasmon resonance and affinity chromatography. Different neuroligins display a range of NX1β affinities spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude. Whereas splice insert 4 in β-neurexin appears to act only as a modulator of the neuroligin/β-neurexin association, splice insert B in neuroligin-1 (NL1) is the key element regulating the NL1/NX1β binding. Our data indicate that gene selection, mRNA splicing, and post-translational modifications combine to give rise to a controlled neuroligin recognition code with a rank ordering of affinities for particular neurexins that is conserved for the neuroligins across mammalian species."}

At first sight, the application of a standard polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) or polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) vascular graft to wrap the ascending aorta in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement with an ascending aortic diameter of 40 to 55 mm sounds simple and attractive. Unfortunately, we identify some concerns with the described technique.\nIn the wrapping group, there was a 14.3% incidence of dissection, with 11.4% suffering an arch dissection (all underwent a reoperation) and 2.9% sustaining a type B dissection. This compares with an 8.6% incidence of dissection (7.1% arch and 1.4% type B) in the replacement group, with 5.7% needing reoperation. It seems that for these patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, both options are unfavorable. Using a linear mixed-effects model, postoperative dilatation of the aortic arch (0.343 mm/year; P = .006) was observed in the wrapping group. The complications arising distal to the treated aorta may indicate that concomitant arch disease should be managed more aggressively in select patients. This becomes even more pertinent when considering that wall stress in the arch increases after wrapping or replacement, as pointed out by the authors.\nThe authors offer 3 insights into the cause of arch dilatation and dissection after wrapping. It was not acknowledged that vascular grafts elicit limited cellular incorporation (Figure 1). By serving as a barrier, they may impair the nutrition of the tunica media, potentially leading to dilatation adjacent to the wrap.2Van Hoof L. Verbrugghe P. Verbeken E. Treasure T. Famaey N.

Conceptual analysis of these verses and hymns suggests a pattern which indicates that these were created skeptically rather than authoritatively, and synthesized with microcosm-macrocosm analogy. On the other hand, there is no evidence of intuitive approach of creating the verses. Since an argument- 'the knowledge was created speculatively by the then scholars not intuitively by the seers' is put forward.

We compute the effect of the deformation operator in the full supersymmetric theory, firstly on a Ramond-Ramond ground state and secondly on states with an initial bosonic or fermionic excitation. Our results generalize recent work which studied only the bosonic sector of the CFT. Our findings are a step towards understanding thermalization in the D1D5 CFT, which is related to black hole formation and evaporation in the bulk."}

This paper discusses the shear strength characteristics of Lishi loess and N2 laterite in the sliding zone under different influencing factors based on in-suit multiple shear tests, and the shear strength characteristics of Lishi loess were contrasted and analyzed based on field and laboratory tests. The results indicated a favorable correlation between the shear strength of soil samples and normal stress. The shear strength attenuation of clay-rich N2 laterite was much larger than that of sand-rich Lishi loess with the increase of the shear stage. Importantly, the mutation points of the shear rate corresponding to the peak stress of soil samples were obtained, which can be used as a symbol to judge the transfixion of the shear plane. Moreover, the stress-strain characteristics of Lishi loess under the same normal load were diverse as a result of the different experimental methods, and the residual strength characteristics for the two tests also varied substantially. Notably, the Lishi loess in the field test has a more stable residual strength than the laboratory direct shear test conducted. The findings can aid in the comprehension of the mechanical behavior of loess and laterite on the Loess Plateau."}

Together with their cellular receptor proteins, cyclophilin (CyP) and FK506-binding protein (FKBP), however, these inhibitors have been shown to have a homogeneous conformation. The existence of a slow cis-trans interconversion of an imidic bond in the inhibitor molecule during the course of the formation of the CsA-CyP18cy complex (where CyP18cy is human 18 kDa cytosolic CyP) prompted us to investigate the reaction of the peptidomacrolides FK506, ascomycin and rapamycin with two specific binding-proteins in more detail. Since formation of the FK506-FKBP complex results in the inhibition of the peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of the binding protein, we used the enzyme's decrease in enzymic activity to monitor binding of the inhibitors to their enzyme targets. For FK506, the kinetics of inhibition of human 12 kDa cytosolic FKBP (FKBP12cy) were clearly dependent on time. Subsequent to a rapid inactivation reaction, not resolved in its kinetics due to manual mixing, a slow dominant first-order inactivation process with a relaxation time of 1163 s at 10 degrees C was observed. Concomitantly the Ki value of the slow phase dropped 2.6-fold within the first 60 min of incubation. Using the FKBP12cy homologue 25 kDa membrane FKBP (FKBP25mem), a bacterial peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase, the rate and amplitudes of the inhibition reactions were very similar to FKBP12cy. On the other hand, the kinetics and amplitudes of the inhibition of FKBP12cy varied significantly if rapamycin was used as an inhibitor instead of FK 506. Owing to reduced conformation transition in rapamycin upon binding to FKBP12cy, the slow phase during inhibition was significantly decreased in amplitude. A likely reason for this became apparent when the activation-enthalpy and the pH-dependence of the rate constants of the slow phase were determined. We conclude that the cis to trans interconversion of the pipecolinyl bond of the three peptidomacrolides may be responsible for the slow process. There was no indication of a suicide catalysis of this process by FKBPs."}

Cellular transplantation to repair a complete spinal cord injury (SCI) is tremendously challenging due to the adverse local milieu for graft survival and growth. Results from cell transplantation studies yield great variability, which may possibly be due to the surgical techniques employed to induce an SCI . In order to delineate the influence of surgery on such inconsistency, we compared lesion morphology and graft survival as well as integration from different lesion methodologies of SCI . Surgical techniques, including a traditional approach cut + microaspiration, and two new approaches, cut alone as well as crush, were employed to produce a complete SCI, respectively. Approximately half of the rats in each group received injury only, whereas the other half received grafts of fetal brainstem cells into the lesion gap. Eight weeks after injury with or without graft, histological analysis showed that the cut + microaspiration surgery resulted in larger lesion cavities and severe fibrotic scars surrounding the cavity, and cellular transplants rarely formed a tissue bridge to penetrate the barrier. In contrast, the majority of cases treated with cut alone or crush exhibited smaller cavities and less scarring; the grafts expanded and blended extensively with the host tissue, which often built continuous tissue bridging the rostral and caudal cords. Scarring and cavitation were significantly reduced when microaspiration was avoided in SCI surgery, facilitating graft/host tissue fusion for signal transmission. The result suggests that microaspiration frequently causes severe scars and cavities, thus impeding graft survival and integration."}

Alexandre Herculano (1810-1877) atuou intensamente nesse sentido, criando uma ficção histórica, característica do Romantismo português, ao trabalhar simultaneamente com objetos históricos e a imaginação. Ao mesmo tempo, percebemos na “Crônica do Descobrimento do Brasil” (1840) de Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (1816-1878) a presença de vários elementos característicos dessa Literatura desenvolvida por Herculano. A partir de uma leitura paralela dos textos de ambos os autores, procura-se perceber os caminhos tomados para a elaboração desse projeto literário oitocentista, que lançava as bases para um romance histórico lusitano, e a forma como tais elementos se desenvolveram nas obras em questão."}

My contention, nevertheless, is that disenchantment, the rupture between myth and place, far from being soulless, as often asserted, is actually the soul's work: its dialectical labour of negation and self-relation: namely, an alchemical opus contra naturam; the distillation of the mercurial logos from the stone: the stone that is no stone."}

The novelty of this network consists in the fact that each neuron is processing its learning as an independent unit, without any higher process or structure.

The growth of computational power in recent years opens new possibilities to the use of neural networks in artificial intelligence."}

The self-biased response was found to be directly related to the nature of magnetization and can be tuned by variation in demagnetization state and the resultant differential magnetic flux distribution. These results present significant advancement toward development of AC magnetic field sensor and magnetoelectric composite based on-chip devices by eliminating the need for DC bias."}

In this study, a proteomic approach was applied to understand the overall physiological importance of vitamin D in the small intestine, beyond its function in calcium and phosphate absorption. In total, 569 protein spots could be detected by two-dimensional-difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), and 82 proteins were considered as differentially regulated in the intestinal mucosa of VDR-deficient mice compared to that of wildtype (WT) mice. Fourteen clearly detectable proteins were identified by MS/MS and further analyzed by western blot and/or real-time RT-PCR. The differentially expressed proteins are functionally involved in cell proliferation, cell adhesion and cell migration, stress response and lipid transport. Mice lacking VDR revealed higher levels of intestinal proteins associated with proliferation and migration such as the 37/67 kDa laminin receptor, collagen type VI (alpha 1 chain), keratin-19, tropomyosin-3, adseverin and higher levels of proteins involved in protein trafficking and stress response than WT mice. In contrast, proteins that are involved in transport of bile and fatty acids were down-regulated in small intestine of mice lacking VDR compared to WT mice. However, plasma and liver concentrations of cholesterol and triglycerides were not different between the two groups of mice. Collectively, these data imply VDR as an important factor for controlling cell proliferation, migration and stress response in the small intestine."}

This paper’s meditation on Fanon and his theorising of the anti-colonial struggle as a peasant revolution is divided into two sections. I will first sketch out the background of colonial Algeria and the nature of anti-colonial liberation in the Third World in the middle of the twentieth century. The second section will discuss Fanon’s conception of revolution in which the peasantry, alongside the “illegalist militants,” initiate a wave of mobilisation that begins in the countryside and embraces the colonised centre of the towns."}

Plants can sense the availability of sulfur, but the sensor has not been identified. Two Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were isolated (termed sel1-15 and sel1-16), that show increased expression of a sulfur-deficiency-activated gene beta glucosidase 28 (BGLU28) when grown on medium with high sulfate content (Zhang et al. 2014). The mutants are missense alleles of SULTR1;2 encoding a high affinity sulfate transportersulfate transporter\n. Although the mutants are defective in sulfate transport they show higher expression of BGLU28 and other sulfur-deficiency-activated genes even when they are treated with a very high dose of sulfate such that the intracellular concentration of sulfate and its metabolite glutathione (GSH) are identical to wild type. The reduced sensitivity to inhibition of gene expression is also observed in sel1 mutants fed with the sulfur assimilation products cysteine and GSH. The results suggest that SULTR1;2 may have a second role in addition to its known function as a high affinity sulfate transporter. It may also have a regulatory role in response to sulfur nutrient status."}

We investigated whether the DNA-binding cell-permeation peptides (CPP) can enhance the transfection efficiency of non-viral vectors in adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) and whether ASCs over-expressing TRAIL through CPP can inhibit the growth of glioma U251MG cells in vitro and in vivo. Materials and Methods: ASCs were genetically engineered to over-express TRAIL by using CPP, pCMV3-TRAIL and lipid-based transfection reagents (X-tremeGENE). Results: The transfection efficiency of ASCs increased by approximately 7% using CPP; 53.9% of ASCs were transfected and TRAIL expression in ASCs increased by approximately 3 times compared to X-tremeGENE alone. ASCs over-expressing TRAIL using CPP inhibited growth of glioma U251MG cells both in vitro and in the U251MG xenograft model. Conclusion: CPP can be used as an enhancer for genetically manipulating ASCs and tumor treatment.</p>"}

Six samples were collected separately from the north of the East China Sea (NECS-02) and waters off Tamsui (Tamsui-10), Taichung (Taichung-11 and Taichung-02), Putai (Putai-02) and Cheding (Cheding-02). Eleven measurements made for each individual were size-standardized by allometric methods and the resulting measurements were analyzed by cluster analysis and canonical variate analysis (CVA). Randomization tests were used to test the morphometric variation between groups derived from cluster analysis and CVA. The results of cluster analysis and CVA indicated that the six samples were clustered into three groups: the first group included the NECS-02 sample; the second included the Tamsui-10 and Taichung-11 samples; and the third included the Taichung-02, Putai-02 and Cheding-02 samples. Randomization tests showed that morphometric differences among the three groups were significant. Animals with the same morphometric measurements are often assumed to constitute a stock, so there appear to be at least three morphologically distinguishable stocks of this species in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait. The first stock is in the north of the East China Sea, the second is in the waters adjacent to Tamsui and Taichung, and the third is in the waters adjacent to Cheding, Putai and Taichung.\n"}

Hand-textured and laboratory-analyzed legacy particle size fraction (PSF) data were obtained from the NRCS National Soil Information System (NASIS). Four models examined various training dataset combinations of new and legacy data. Three PSF sub-models and maps were created for clay, silt, and sand for each parent model. The PSF maps were converted to a soil texture classification map using SAGA 7.4.0 and compared against the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). A set of 320 covariates were provided to Cubist, a machine learning algorithm, to make the data combination models. Twenty-seven rasters were developed to capture eolian sediment transport distribution across the study area. A detailed methodology and case study was used to determine the utility of these rasters as predictors for surface silt content across the Iowan Erosion Surface. The case study showed that the eolian sediment transport distribution rasters were frequently selected by Cubist, but resulted in a higher RMSE and a lower Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) during independent map validation than the model that excluded those covariates. Streaking artifacts present in the directional distance rasters suggest that methodological refinement is needed. At the PSF level, maps that included legacy data as a supplement to the new dataset returned lower RMSE and higher CCC statistics during independent validation. Similarly, the confusion matrices of the soil texture class maps showed that the combined new and legacy data maps outperformed maps trained exclusively with new data. The new data map correctly predicted soil texture class with 27% accuracy, while the maps with new and legacy data had correct classification between 39% and 42%. The results suggest that incorporating new and legacy data is an effective approach for predicting soil texture class. However, the SSURGO soil texture class map outperformed all new and legacy data combination maps with a classification accuracy of 58%."}
