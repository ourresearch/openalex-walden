The results indicate a consistent increase in critical bandwidth with level of the two masking tones (approximately 3%/dB). Irregularities in the individual two-tone masking functions led to further investigations with a single listener. For subcritical frequency separations between masking tones, -10 dB/decade masking slopes were demonstrated along with large dips or notches in the two-tone masking functions. Both the -10 dB/decade masking slopes and the large notches were replicated in detail when only the lower-frequency tones of the two-tone masking pairs were employed as maskers. Separate masking bands were then introduced that eliminated the -10 dB/decade masking slope and the large notch. It is concluded that the two-tone masking experiment is really a single-tone experiment, and that the detection of beats, roughness, and combination tones determines the form of single-tone and two-tone masking functions. If critical bnadwidth estimates are to be obtained from these experiments, it is most appropriate to refer to those estimates as \""critical bandwidths for tonal interaction\"".""}"

We derive and discuss the dispersion relations for charge-density excitations within the framework of Bohm-Pines' random-phase approximation. The magnetoplasmons in a 2DEG are known to be characterized by two important properties: (i) the oscillatory behavior of the dispersion curves in the short wavelength limit (SWL) and (ii) the resonance splitting at the frequency $\\ensuremath{\\omega}=n{\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$ in the long wavelength limit (LWL); $n\\phantom{\\rule{0.2em}{0ex}}(\\ensuremath{\\geqslant}2)$ being an integer and ${\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$ the cyclotron frequency. Here we study the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interactions (SOIs) on these characteristics in depth. We observe that the SOI modifies drastically both the oscillatory behavior in the SWL and yields multiple resonance splittings [at $\\ensuremath{\\omega}=(n\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}{x}_{0}){\\ensuremath{\\omega}}_{c}$] in the LWL. Such resonance splittings make the spintronic systems potential candidates for quantum-well-based new devices as spin filters.

The recent trend for numerical experiment requires more higher resolution and accuracy. Generally, in the wave field calculation, it starts with a large region formulation first and follows by a separated detailed region formulation by more denser grids for the main interest area considering the geographical and bathymetrical variation. The wave fields resulted from the large region calculation is being introduced into the detail region calculation as the incident waves. In this process there exists a problem of continuity. In order to get over such problem, method of variable gridding system or spectrum sampling, etc., is being used. However, it seems not enough to examine and analyze the related numerical errors. Therefore, it is investigated in this study the field applicability of the most pervasive use of wave model, the nested SWAN model. For this purpose, we made model experiment for two coastal harbours with different tidal environment, and compared and analyzed the result. From the analysis, it was found that both the extracted values, near the boundaries of the large and detail region and the nested formulation of SWAN model, show almost the same and no different between those with different tidal environment conditions. However it is necessary for reducing the numerical errors to set the boundaries for the detailed region outside of the rapid bathymetric change and deeper region.""}"

Coomaraswamy; economist and diplomat Dag Hammarskjöld; and Cistercian monk and author Thomas Merton, invites us to reconsider the life and legacy of Greek-Armenian George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff. For many, the title may surprise. Reconsider? Who now has considered Gurdjieff, even once? Now referred to as \""the Work,\"" the way of Gurdjieff, based on inner study rather than on faith, has fallen out of the public eye. Born (circa 1870) in Armenia, the young Gurdjieff spent some twenty years traveling—from Greece to Egypt, to the Caucasus and Tibet—with a small band of companions in search of esoteric knowledge. Much of what we know about these years derives from Gurdjieff's semi-fictional autobiography, Meetings with Remarkable Men (1963), on which Peter Brook based his eponymous film (1979). By 1912, Gurdjieff was teaching in Moscow and St Petersburg. In 1917, forced to flee the revolution, he made his way with followers to Essentuki, Georgia. In 1919, he and his pupils fled again, across the Caucasus and eventually to France, where Gurdjieff resided, first at the Prieuré at Fontainebleau, and later in a small apartment in Paris, until his death in 1949. Gurdjieff's pupils found, in the master's work and in his presence, personal hope and meaning despite brutal conditions—revolution, depression, holocaust, and world war. At the same time, as shared by Gurdjieff with his French pupils during the war, Gurdjieff's great aim is ultimately a work for one's neighbor: \""I swear to myself that this will never be for my personal profit, but to help others. I wish to be, to help others. This is to be understood as a vow.\"" In her forward, Cynthia Bourgeault writes, For those unfamiliar with this teaching, I might describe it as an early run-up on what we would now call \""mindfulness training,\"" combined with an even more intricate metaphysics. … But the Work also has extraordinary heart, carried largely in the aforementioned sacred [End Page 21] dances (or \""Movements,\"" as they are more widely known), which provide not only a powerful integrative counterbalance to the intellectual content but also a de facto liturgical expression of searing emotional intensity. As Lipsey points out, the word \""reconsidered,\"" \""promises either the refinement of an existing reputation or a radical break from received opinion.\"" With the same friendly, almost intimate tone he used so successfully in his work on Hammarskjöld and Merton, Lipsey is a helpful guide with a sensitive touch. A senior member of the Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, he is very able to provide insight. His extensive use of primary sources, both published accounts and unpublished manuscripts held in public libraries and private archives, vividly evokes both the man and his community of pupils. Lipsey avoids expounding the teaching, trusting that as a lived practice, the teaching will appear in each reported exchange. There are a few exceptions—for example, an extensive discussion of the key concept \""being.\"" To those impatient with the extensive terminology introduced by Gurdjieff in his early teaching period in Russia, the \""theory\"" decade, Lipsey offers this comparison: For the anonymous fourteenth century author of The Cloud of Unknowing, a perfectly stunning guide to progressive exploration of the inner life, the diligent and fortunate seeker comes upon zones of experience that can only be described metaphorically. Slowly, a portrait emerges that is deeply nuanced and humane. In the chapter on the Prieuré, an abundance of vignettes about the life of the community places the teaching in context. It is a rich tapestry, with colorful personae: Katherine Mansfield, A. R. Orage, T. Tchekhovitch, the De Salzmann's, and all the children who lived at the châteaux, to name only a few, and Gurdjieff himself, frequently playing the role of provocateur. Lipsey finds kinship with Pythagoras and imagines Gurdjieff as spiritual heir of Diogenes the Cynic. Here is Katherine Mansfield, from...""}"

Despite homologous structures and essentially identical iron binding sites, Tf begins to release iron at pH 6.0, whereas Lf retains iron to pH approximately 3.5. This difference in iron retention gives the two proteins different biological roles. Two lysine residues, Lys 206 and Lys 296, which form a hydrogen-bonded dilysine pair in human Tf, have been shown to strongly influence iron release from the N-lobe. The equivalent residues in human Lf are Arg 210 and Lys 301, and we have here mutated Arg 210 in the N-lobe half-molecule of human lactoferrin, Lf(N), to probe its role in iron release. The Lf(N) mutants R210G, R210E, and R210L were expressed, purified, and crystallized, and their crystal structures were determined and refined at resolutions of 1.95 A (R210G), 2.2 A (R210E), and 2.0 A (R210L). The overall structures are very similar to that of wild-type Lf(N), but with small differences in domain orientations. In each of the mutants, however, Lys 301 (equivalent to Lys 296 in Tf) changes its conformation to fill the space occupied by Arg 210 Neta2 in wild-type Lf(N), interacting with the two tyrosine ligands Tyr 92 and Tyr 192. By comparison with other Lf and Tf structures, we conclude that Lys 301 (or Lys 296 in Tf) only occupies this site when residue 210 (206 in Tf) is nonpositive (neutral as in R210G and R210L or negative as in R210E). Thus, Lys 206 in the Tf dilysine pair is identified as having a depressed pK(a). Three specific sites are variably occupied by polar groups in the Lf mutants and other Lf and Tf proteins, and when coupled with iron-release data, these give new insights into the factors that most influence iron retention at low pH.""}"

Understanding the risk-allele-specific pathogenesis has the potential to improve personalized diabetes treatment, but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we now show that the K23 variant impairs glucose-induced insulin secretion and increases diabetes risk when combined with a high-fat diet (HFD) and obesity. KATP-channels in β-cells with two K23 risk alleles (KK) showed decreased ATP inhibition, and the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from KK islets was increased. Consequently, the insulin response to glucose and glycemic control was impaired in KK mice fed a standard diet. On an HFD, the effects of the KK genotype were exacerbated, accelerating diet-induced diabetes progression and causing β-cell failure. We conclude that the K23 variant increases diabetes risk by impairing insulin secretion at threshold glucose levels, thus accelerating loss of β-cell function in the early stages of diabetes progression.""}"

Existem dados evolutivos, anatômicos e neuroendócrinos em favor desta afirmação. OBJETIVOS: Verificar a medida do comprimento do intestino delgado em pacientes obesos submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica e analisar a correlação entre o seu tamanho e o IMC. MÉTODO: A casuística foi composta de 30 pacientes do Serviço de Obesidade do Hospital Universitário Evangélico de Curitiba, submetidos à cirurgia bariátrica no período de março a junho de 2009, e previamente avaliados, verificando peso, altura e IMC. A técnica cirúrgica foi a de Fobi-Capella. A mensuração do intestino delgado foi realizada desde a flexura duodenojejunal à junção ileocecal, durante o trans-operatório, utilizando uma pinça de manipulação intestinal, a qual foi marcada com a medida de 10 cm. As alças intestinais foram medidas na margem anti-mesentérica, aplicando-se tensão mínima necessária para retificar as mesmas. Os dados foram correlacionados e tabulados estatisticamente, utilizando-se o método de correlação de Pearson. RESULTADOS: A média do comprimento intestinal para o sexo masculino foi de 582,5 cm e para o sexo feminino de 509,1. A partir do cálculo do coeficiente de correlação de Pearson, confirmou-se a ausência de correlação entre IMC e comprimento do intestino delgado. CONCLUSÃO: Obteve-se uma média de tamanho intestinal de 528,7 cm para toda a amostra. O comprimento do intestino delgado não possuiu correspondência com o IMC, não sendo um fator de significância neste estudo.""}"

Schumacher Among the reasons to rejoice over the year 2018 is, Pope Francis mentions in his Christmas greetings to the Roman Curia, the canonization of the nineteen martyrs of Algeria: \""nineteen lives given for Christ, for his Gospel and for the Algerian people . . . models of everyday holiness, the holiness of 'the saints next door,'\"" he explains.1 These so-called \""ordinary\"" saints are nonetheless extraordinary, for they proclaimed their faith in Christ by the shedding of their blood. In these lives fully surrendered to Christ, there is an exact accordance between the message and the messenger. Their final proclamation is perfect, because they witness to what the Catechism presents as \""an organic connection between our spiritual life and the dogmas [of our faith],\""2 that is to say, the content of what the Church proposes as worthy of faith and even \""obliging\""3 for those who bear the name of Christ. Their martyrdom, likened unto that of Christ himself, embodies what Pope Francis calls \""the divine logic that does not halt before evil, but instead transforms it . . . into goodness.\"" It likewise reminds us that \""God's salvation, freely bestowed on all humanity . . . does not act independently of our will, our cooperation, our freedom and our daily efforts.\"" \""Salvation is a gift, true enough,\"" Francis continues in his typically matter-of-fact manner, \""but one that must be accepted, cherished and made to bear fruit (cf. Mt 25: 14-30).\""4 [End Page 323] How different is this attitude from that of those chided by the Pope for \""frequently com[ing] to think and act as if they were the owners of salvation and not its recipients, like overseers of the mysteries of God and not their humble ministers, like God's toll-keepers and not servants of the flock entrusted to their care.\"" \""Instead of following God,\"" they put themselves \""in front of him,\"" Pope Francis suggests, \""like Peter, who remonstrated with the Master and thus merited the most severe of Christ's rebukes: 'Get behind me, Satan! For you are setting your mind not on the things of God but on the things of men' (Mk 8:33).\"" Likening these unfaithful servants to King David, who committed the triple sin of \""sexual abuse, abuse of power and abuse of conscience,\"" Francis observes that they take \""advantage of their position and their power of persuasion. They perform abominable acts, yet continue to exercise their ministry as if nothing had happened. They have no fear of God or his judgement, but only of being found out and unmasked.\"" They discredit \""the Church's saving mission and the sacrifices of so many of their confrères.\"" In contrast to those who witness to Christ, even to the point of death, they, like Judas, are willing to sell him for thirty pieces of silver. In short, by their \""infidelity and shame,\"" they \""disfigure the countenance of the Church and undermine her credibility.\""5 A Crisis of Credibility: A Crisis of Faith A \""crisis of credibility\"" is, in fact, what we are currently experiencing in the Church, Francis suggests no less than six times in his letter to the bishops of the United States on the occasion of their recent retreat at Mundelein Seminary (January 2–8, 2019). \""The Church's credibility has been seriously undercut and diminished by these sins and crimes, but even more,\"" he explains, \""by the efforts made to deny or conceal them. This has led to a growing sense of uncertainty, distrust and vulnerability among the faithful.\""6 To be sure, some have recognized in Pope Francis' words of reproach just another example of the very attitudes behind much of the scandalous cover-up at the heart of this crisis, namely the fear that \""This makes us look bad.\"" Hence, for example, Amy Welborn asks in reaction to this letter whether the problem is not to be situated in the sins of using people, of doing \""great harm to God's children,\"" and of \""offend[ing] and disobey[ing] God who created us for good, not evil\""—rather than in the diminished [End Page 324] credibility of the institution and...""}"

RAS blockade users showed an increased risk of renal death in PS-matched analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.381; 95% CI, 1.071-1.781; P = 0.013), which was in agreement with the results of IPTW analysis (HR, 1.298; 95% CI, 1.123-1.500; P < 0.001).

Yet the discipline's institutions, networks, and social practices were firmly embedded in the particular social fabric of concrete locales, and they were built on specific local traditions, resources, and patronage. Through analysis of the origins and early progress of Soviet endocrinology, this essay uncovers numerous factors and multiple actors involved with the institutional development of the discipline in the first decade of Bolshevik rule. As elsewhere in the world, the medicinal use of animal tissue extracts--organotherapy--paved the way for wide acceptance of the ideas of the nascent science of endocrinology by both the Soviet medical community and the general public. Organotherapy also supplied the new discipline with \""seed\"" institutions, technologies, and personnel--the veterinarian Iakov Tobolkin and the therapist Vasilii Shervinskii. But the specific institutional, political, economic, and ideological landscape of Soviet Russia shaped the discipline in a particular way.""}"

To study further the nuclease involved in this process, an assay system was developed to measure internucleosomal DNA degradation. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase), a bacterial enzyme that cleaves chromatin at internucleosomal intervals, was used to validate the assay procedure. Thymocyte nuclear proteins obtained from glucocorticoid-treated chickens, a source of internucleosomal DNA-degrading activity, were incubated with chicken red blood cell nuclei, and genomic DNA was subsequently extracted and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Generation of internucleosomal DNA degradation products by the thymocyte protein extract required ATP and was both time and protein concentration dependent. This nuclease activity could be inhibited by EDTA, EGTA, alkylating agents, or heat denaturation. Addition of purified proteinases, RNases, or other types of nucleases to the assay failed to generate discrete internucleosomal lengths of DNA, thus confirming the nuclease specificity of this assay. On the basis of these data, we believe that this assay system will be instrumental in isolating and characterizing the nuclease(s) associated with apoptosis.""}"

Although there was some overlapping of species, multivariate analysis using cluster analysis for classification and multidimensional scaling (MDS) for ordination, showed that there were significant differences between the five gears in terms of species composition and biomasses discarded, with the least similarity between crustacean trawling and all other fishing operations. The differences between fisheries were probably as a result of a combination of gear selectivity and depth fished. The results suggest that discarding practices are likely to have different, yet significant impacts on the marine ecosystem, warranting further studies on the fate of discards, the factors influencing discarding and mitigation.""}"

Although based on few locality records, the New Zealand species of Cymonomus show north-south distributions corresponding to the Aupourian and Cookian Provinces, respectively, demarcated by the subtropical convergence in the vicinity of the Chatham Rise. Notably, the New Zealand species, C. clarki, is the southernmost occurring cymonomid worldwide. Most Australian records of Cymonomus are from southern waters; few are known from northern Western Australia or Queensland, and none from the Northern Territory, probably reflecting limited sampling effort. One new species from Tasmania is unique in Cymonomus in having transparent, well-defined corneas, rather than opaque-translucent corneal surfaces that are undifferentiated from surrounding cuticle. The New Zealand and Australian species of Cymonomus belong to species groups that range widely in the Indo-West Pacific, or even globally; whether these groups represent natural divisions awaits revision of the Atlanto-East Pacific cymonomid fauna.

The specific objectives were to identify socio-economic characteristics of farm households; and determine the degree of their vulnerability to desertification. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 633 respondents from 18 rural communities across six Local Government Areas (LGAs). Data from 21 indicators for the three components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) were used to measure the degree of vulnerability and thus, classify households into less, moderate and highly vulnerable. The study found that households in Jibia LGA were less vulnerable, with a VI of 1.228, while Kaita, Mashi, and Mai'adua LGAs were moderately vulnerable with VI of 0.523, 0.756, and 0.685, respectively. Households in Zango and Baure LGAs were found to be highly vulnerable due to poor biophysical conditions, with indices of 1.629 and -1.405, respectively. Furthermore, while 49% of the total households sampled were moderately vulnerable to desertification, 30% were less vulnerable and 21% were found to be highly vulnerable. As a result, the study recommended that the need for vegetative cover regeneration, soil quality rehabilitation, increased irrigation use, and biomass stability that take into account the vagaries of climate be prioritized in order to support, rescue, and increase the resilience of vulnerable households.

To address this, we used an ovine model of aging with tachypacing-induced HF to determine whether aging affects the chronotropic and inotropic responses to autonomic stimulation and reduction in heart rate variability (HRV) in HF. We find that aging is associated with increased cardiac dimensions and reduced contractility before the onset of tachypacing, and these differences persist in HF. Additionally, the chronotropic response to β-adrenergic stimulation was markedly attenuated in HF, and this occurred more rapidly in aged animals. By measuring HR during sequential autonomic blockade, our data are consistent with a reduced parasympathetic control of resting HR in aging, with young HF animals having an attenuated sympathetic influence on HR. Time-domain analyses of HR show a reduction in HRV in both young and aged failing animals, although HRV is lowest in aged HF. In conclusion, aging is associated with altered autonomic control and β-adrenergic responsiveness of HR, and these are exacerbated with the development of HF.""}"

Their dynamics are strongly modulated by thermal stratification and surface meteorological forcing. This study examines the influence of interannual meteorological variability from 1980 to 2010 on internal wave behavior using a series of numerical simulations in Lake Biwa in Japan. In each simulation, air temperature, wind speed, or precipitation was perturbed by ±2 standard deviations relative to the climatological mean. Power spectral analysis of simulated velocity fields was conducted for the surface, thermocline, and bottom layers, focusing on super-inertial (6–16 h), near-inertial (~16–30 h), and sub-inertial (&gt;30 h) frequency bands. The results show that higher air temperatures intensify stratification and enhance near-inertial internal waves, particularly within the thermocline, whereas cooler conditions favor sub-inertial wave dominance. Increased wind speeds amplify internal wave energy across all layers, with the strongest effect occurring in the high-frequency band due to intensified wind stress and vertical shear, while weaker winds suppress wave activity. Precipitation variability primarily affects surface stratification, exerting more localized and weaker impacts. These findings highlight the non-linear, depth-dependent responses of internal waves to atmospheric drivers and improve understanding of the coupling between climate variability and internal wave energetics. The insights gained provide a basis for more accurate predictions and sustainable management of stratified aquatic ecosystems under future climate scenarios.""}"

Eight natural populations were sampled in the New‐Caledonian archipelago, a total of 157 individuals being analyzed. The main components, as revealed by gas chromatography (GC), were α ‐ and β ‐santalol (as in other sandalwood species), although the level of ( Z )‐lanceol was particularly high. Most of the chemical variation was observed within populations (83.7%). With microsatellites, the variation between populations was more pronounced (32% of the total variation). Although the chemical variation between populations was small, we investigated the effects of genetic drift and migration by comparing the chemical‐ and molecular‐differentiation patterns. The poor congruence between neighbor‐joining trees, confirmed by the non‐significant Mantel test between the molecular and chemical distance matrices ( R =0.26, P =0.12), showed that genetic drift and migration are not the main evolutionary forces acting on chemical differentiation between populations. We could not find any effect of soil and rainfall conditions neither. Although the impact of drift and migration cannot be discounted in rationalizing between‐population differentiation, the low variation among populations could result from a stabilizing selection caused by the same phytopathogen charge across the natural range.""}"

Im Rahmen der Erythrozytose kann es zu Symptomen kommen, die durch die erhöhte Blutviskosität bestimmt sind. Weitere Symptome sind ein aquagener Pruritus und die Erythromelalgie. Die häufigsten Komplikationen sind thromboembolische Ereignisse. Risikofaktoren dafür sind ein höheres Lebensalter (&gt;60 Jahre) und eine bereits stattgehabte Thrombose.

General Edwin Walker became a problem for the U.S. military starting in World War II, when he launched an anti-communist training program he called Pro-Blue. He was not the only decorated officer to use his authority for political reasons, but he only grew more vociferous and controversial as his career extended into the Cold War era. After a Senate subcommittee started investigating his attacks on Democratic politicians and interest groups in 1961, Walker resigned, which ignited a firestorm of protest by conservatives who charged that the government was “muzzling” him. Among Walker’s most ardent defenders was a new generation of evangelical ministers preaching on radio stations across the country. “Walker might have been just a disgraced former general,” writes author Paul Matzko in The Radio Right, “were it not for the right-wing broadcasters who turned him into a conservative cause célèbre” (p. 70). Matzko’s recently published monograph, and those of scholars Catherine McNichol Stock and Lauren Kerby, explore this convergence of religious and nationalist fervor from different vantage points in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. These three books parse the fusion of Christian evangelical and patriotic expression that became conservative America’s song of itself. Matzko’s history of evangelical broadcast media, Stock’s study of movement politics on the Northern Plains, and Kerby’s ethnography of Christian Heritage tourism in Washington D.C. represent the latest contributions in the rich and expansive literature on conservative political culture in the United States. [End Page 468] In Nuclear Country: The Origins of the Rural New Right, Catherine Stock takes a regional approach to the history of American conservatism, offering a welcome turn away from the already deeply studied South and Sun Belt. North and South Dakota enjoy stronger representation per resident in the United States Senate since they elect two Senators, as much as every other state, despite their low population. Their rural history, moreover, offers a valuable opportunity to apply spatial analysis to study the dynamics of agrarian politics at the state and local level. Stock is the person to do this, since Nuclear Country appears on the heels of her prior book Rural Radicals: Righteous Rage in the American Grain (2018). Stock’s previous work launches her study of the postwar Right by asking how communities that seeded and nourished the left-wing populist tradition of the early twentieth century could then become hotbeds of conservatism. Her explanation is militarization and nuclearization. The analysis of Nuclear Country reaches outward from an ironic heart—that this wellspring of popular democracy, agrarian socialism that resisted “‘bigness’ in all its forms” ultimately welcomed an aggressive expansion of military bases and nuclear arsenals into their communities (p. 4). Chapter 1 locates the origins of the agrarian conservative movement both and outside the radical groups that lit the early “political prairie fires.” The story begins here, with a somewhat familiar march of populism from the Left to the Right of the political spectrum as documented in Kathryn Law Olmsted’s Right Out of California, Darren Dochuk’s From Bible Belt to Sunbelt and others. The pro-business Dakota Republicans who opposed agrarian leftists promoted laissez-faire economic policies and Protestant religion that “set the stage for the national movement of businesspeople against the New Deal and, subsequently, the rise of the new conservatism” (p. 31). The evangelical Protestantism that thrived among the leftists, however, grew increasingly illiberal after the Great Depression took hold in the 1930s. The opposition to “bigness” did not abate, but struggling workers, farmers, and businesspeople...""}"

Atherosclerosis is initiated by endothelium activation and, followed by a cascade of events (accumulation of lipids, fibrous elements, and calcification), triggers the vessel narrowing and activation of inflammatory pathways. The resultant atheroma plaque, along with these processes, results in cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the different stages of atherosclerosis development, ranging from endothelial dysfunction to plaque rupture. In addition, the post-transcriptional regulation and modulation of atheroma plaque by microRNAs and lncRNAs, the role of microbiota, and the importance of sex as a crucial risk factor in atherosclerosis are covered here in order to provide a global view of the disease.""}"

Initially, this appeared a forlorn hope: while Davidson (a former journalist) performed well at Holyrood and in the media, electoral support continued to ebb away. Even during the 2012-14 independence referendum campaign, Conservatives (and Unionists) struggled to derive political capital. Only in 2016, as another referendum on Brexit loomed, did Scottish Conservatives gain some momentum, becoming the principal opposition party in the Scottish Parliament in 2016 and gaining a dozen MPs at the 2017 UK general election. This momentum, however, had stalled by 2019 and Ruth Davidson resigned as leader. Though it remained more popular than they had been pre-2016, Scottish Conservatives once again found themselves on the back foot, not only over Brexit but growing support for a second independence referendum. They were also forced to grapple with a more ‘muscular unionism’ emanating from Westminster, which had less patience for accommodating Scottish demands within the Union.""}"

According to the empirical results, this paper further elaborates the causes of the bubble. The results indicate that: 1) The study chooses a measurement indicator and constructs a real estate bubble measurement system from the perspectives of supply and demand, investment, and credit. 2) Whichever method is used, the measurement results indicate that exists a bubble, and it shows a clear upward trend. It’s concluded that: 1) There are many causes of the real estate bubble in Guangzhou, including imbalances in supply and demand, land costs, speculation, and financial expansion, et al. 2) The measurement results of the Guangzhou real estate bubble can provide relevant evidence for the government to formulate policies or means to curb the economic bubble.""}"

The average long-range structure of CaIrO 3 , visible from Rietveld structure refinement, is distinct from the short-range structure (≤ 18 Å) at all of the temperatures examined in this study (325–1114 K) and is reproduced in structure models fitted to the pair-distribution function extending to sufficiently long atom-pair distances (≥ 50 Å). While previous data obtained with Rietveld structure refinement show the iridium coordination octahedra to distort with increasing temperature, models of the short-range structure demonstrate that these polyhedra instead reduce distortion and rotate in a manner similar to that occurring in the perovskite structure.""}"

The article starts with a discussion of the MNL, explicitly discussing least squares and maximum likelihood techniques that are used to calibrate the model, as well as hypothesis tests and measures of model fit. The IIA problem associated with the MNL model is discussed. This leads to a discussion of the multinomial probit (MNP) model, the second most popularly used choice model in Marketing, which alleviates some of the concerns arising out of the IIA problem. Estimating the MNP model, which does not have an analytical closed form (as does the MNL), requires simulation methods. Two popularly used simulation techniques, the frequency‐based simulator and the smooth recursive conditioning (SRC) simulator, are discussed in detail. Lastly, the article briefly discusses some alternative choice models (generalized extreme value (GEV), nested logit, Batsell and Polking) that also relax the IIA restriction of the MNL model, while also yielding closed‐form choice probabilities.""}"

A new history reveals how-and why. Wiretapping is nearly as old as electronic communications. Telegraph operators intercepted enemy messages during the Civil War. Law enforcement agencies were listening to private telephone calls as early as 1895. Communications firms have assisted government eavesdropping programs since the early twentieth century-and they have spied on their own customers too. Such breaches of privacy once provoked outrage, but today most Americans have resigned themselves to constant electronic monitoring. How did we get from there to here? In The Listeners, Brian Hochman shows how the wiretap evolved from a specialized intelligence-gathering tool to a mundane fact of life. He explores the origins of wiretapping in military campaigns and criminal confidence games and tracks the use of telephone taps in the US government's wars on alcohol, communism, terrorism, and crime. While high-profile eavesdropping scandals fueled public debates about national security, crime control, and the rights and liberties of individuals, wiretapping became a routine surveillance tactic for private businesses and police agencies alike. From wayward lovers to foreign spies, from private detectives to public officials, and from the silver screen to the Supreme Court, The Listeners traces the long and surprising history of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping in the United States. Along the way, Brian Hochman considers how earlier generations of Americans confronted threats to privacy that now seem more urgent than ever""}"

This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of insect extracts against Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of thirteen crude extracts of medicinal insects were tested against twelve Gram-negative bacteria by diffusion on agar. Imipenem was used as an antibiotic for positive control. The thirteen extracts acted differently against certain Gram-negative bacteria. The largest inhibition diameter was for extracts of Cirina butyrospermi and Mylabris variabilis against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 and Salmonella enteritidis ATCC13076, respectively. The diameters of inhibition obtained using imipenem against these same bacterial strains were 13.0 ± 0.0 mm and 22 ± 1.0 mm, respectively. The lowest inhibition diameter (7.5 ± 0.0 mm) was obtained using Anopheles gambiae extract against Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC14028. Imipenem was active on all strains tested. The highest values of the index multi-resistance to insect’s extracts were reported for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027 and Serratia odorifera 652411. Overall, the results of this study confirmed the antibacterial activities of insects used by traditional health practitioners to treat different pathologies. Entomotherapy could be an alternative treatment for certain infectious pathologies caused by gram-negative bacteria.""}"

Kelly, for example, having studied the use of Pelagius' writings in Hiberno-Latin literature, and in continental writings with an Irish link, concluded:Available evidence links the Irish somehow to every known use of Pelagius by name in the early Middle Ages and to considerable anonymous use as well.There are a number of ways to explain this phenomenon.One way, however, not to explain it is as a Pelagian party or movement in the Irish church.Most of the Irish use of Pelagius was selective and for explication of certain passages.Nowhere was Pelagius used to exclusion of orthodox Fathers, especially not to his adversaries Augustine and Jerome.His use simply does not reflect Pelagian attitudes. 2 Kelly pointed out that all the known Irish uses of Pelagius' writings are those taken from his Expositiones XIII epistolarum Pauli, which contain only one seriously 'Pelagian' comment, that on Romans 5:15, which is not used by the Irish writers except once where it is cited and highlighted as erroneous: 'this is an answer to the lies of the heretics.' 3 In other words, though the Irish were happy to use Pelagius' commentary on the Pauline epistles, there is no evidence that they adopted Pelagian theology.Indeed the way they used Pelagius' commentary suggests that they were both aware of, and determined to avoid, his views on grace and nature.Other scholars have formed the view that the evidence of British and Irish sources points towards a non-Pelagian but pre-Augustinian orthodoxy on the questions of grace that lie at the heart of the Pelagian dispute. 4 Prior to the dispute between Augustine and Pelagius in the 1""}"

Their exposure to radicals occurs on short millisecond time scales and has been consistently found not to cause any measurable structural damage or conformational change to proteins in a number of published reports. Consistent with these studies, S-peptide is preferentially protected from reactions with radicals under conditions in which it is bound to S-protein. Conversely, a region of S-protein comprising residues 96-100 constitutes the S-peptide binding domain based on its diminished reactivity with radicals within the RNase-S complex over the free S-protein.

The own-rates of interest analysis offers an important avenue by which to demonstrate Keynes's claim for the existence of unemployment equilibria. Keynes based his argument in this area on forces integral to an economy faced with uncertainty, where asset holders might choose to fly to safety. In such an economy he suggested there would be (at least) one asset exhibiting a liquidity premia in excess of its carrying cost. This is how he defined a monetary economy. This existence did not make the attainment of full-employment impossible, though, as Leijonhufvud argues. It does mean, however, that — given institutions, expectations and the propensities to save and to consume — it is possible for new investment activity to get hung up at a level lower than the full-employment level of savings. What would happen then? One possibility is that output adjusts to this new lower level of demand and settles into a less-than-full employment equilibrium.""}"

And it's promising that issues long neglected—the crisis of care, the undervaluation of the work of social reproduction, and the corrosive, life-sapping stresses on poor families—are on the Biden administration's radar. Yet worrisome motifs keep surfacing in family policy debate. I wince every time Biden's American Families Plan is defended as \""putting women back to work,\"" or boosting \""productivity\"" and making the United States more competitive by upping women's \""labor force participation.\"" Why are only employed women considered productive and a boon to the economy? The overreliance on a market rationale for family policy is a dangerous road to travel if our desired end is valuing the work of caregiving regardless of where it occurs. Just as troubling is the failure to make clear that direct cash subsidies to families with dependents, whether or not there is a wage earner in the household, are as crucial as government investments in the care economy aimed at facilitating market work (child care, pre-K, elder care). These are two sides of the same care coin and must be seen as inseparable. Taken together, such programs value care work inside and outside the home, lessen economic anxiety for families, boost the well-being of adults and children, and give caregivers, especially women, more control over where and when they work. But it's not just how the programs are sometimes spun that's a problem. There's a huge underdeveloped piece in all of Biden's major proposals: making jobs more family friendly. Raising pay is, of course, absolutely essential to creating family-friendly jobs, and it's gratifying, after almost a half-century of economic nonsense, to see the Democrats and the liberal intellectual classes applaud the Fight for $15 and rediscover the economic virtues of worker power. Yet if families are to thrive, the way we work must change too. That means paying attention to time as well as money. [End Page 58] Worker demands for shorter hours and fair wages have long animated male-led labor movements in the United States, as elsewhere. Less well known are the efforts of labor women to refashion these core trade union tenets into a sophisticated feminist family politics. Most relevant for contemporary purposes are the comprehensive and far-seeing proposals put forward by leading women labor activists after the Second World War. Labor women's family policy starts from the premise that involuntary market work is a problem for working-class women of all races. Employers and policymakers have never valued the homes and children of the working classes as much as they did those of middle-class white women. As a result, working-class women have had to fight for the right to family time and time apart from the market as well as the right to income and a job. Workingclass women are not more \""conservative\"" or family-oriented than other women. But the home-job calculus is different for an income-strapped mother facing the prospect of cleaning animal entrails in a slaughterhouse than it is for a professional woman contemplating a lucrative, rewarding career. Mid-century labor feminists pursued a package of reforms to boost household income and give working-class women more control over their time. Women, like men, they insisted, deserved a market wage sufficient for self-support and the support of dependents. Strengthening unions, enacting higher legislative wage minimums, and securing equal pay for equal work raised wages and allowed for more time apart from employment. Labor women achieved some significant victories in the fight for wage justice, including the first federal Equal Pay Act in 1963, aimed at ending wage disparities based on sex, and, in 1966, the extension minimum wage coverage to millions of workers in service, government, and agricultural jobs for the first time. But they also believed that increasing social wages, or income to individuals and families from the state, was as important as increasing market wages. With religious groups opposed (unlike in many other nations), business...""}"

In the first facility, which is located in North America, the values of cycle time and WIP inventory predicted by each model are about 10% higher than the actual values observed in the facility. The estimates are on the high side because managers and operators in the facility take special action to expedite production whenever queues become too large or small. These special actions cannot be incorporated into the open queueing network models. In the second facility, which is taken from the literature, the values of cycle time and WIP predicted by each model are about 5% higher than the values reported in the literature. An investigation at a third facility located in South-east Asia identified a common manufacturing practice that caused a model assumption to be violated. New insights into the models and directions for future research are identified. We find that two of the four open queueing network models are easy to apply and give good results for facilities like the ones studied in this paper.

It is an oasis of rhythms: a large body of water rising, falling, and rising again. My son approached these waves with delight, eyes sparkling, and voice pitched high. Yet he stood back a bit, not quite ready to jump in, a bit apprehensive. He was displaying two basic emotions: joy and fear. He seemed to experience them nearly simultaneously, even though they are very different feeling states. Where did he get such a rich feeling repertoire? Allow me to review some possibilities. First, we might consider emotions to be a sensory experience, like hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch. It could be a sixth sense, focused not on the detection of external events but on internal states, not so different from sensing muscle tone within our bodies. Though part of what we mean by emotion may be captured as a sensory experience, there are a few difficulties with this idea. First, anatomically, no specific area exists in the cortex for an emotional sense, as exists for the five senses.""}"

Therefore, the combustion consequence should be analyzed to demonstrate that the containment integrity is not being challenged for the hydrogen risk when the flame acceleration risk cannot be safely ruled out. Considering the uncertainties of both the combustion model and severe accident analysis, the criteria and experimentally based combustion (CREBCOM) model is adopted to provide a conservative result for pressure and the thermal load for combustion analyses in this study. Firstly, the CREBCOM is developed in the GASFLOW-MPI code and validated with the RUT experiment. The result shows that the CREBCOM model can provide a reliable overpressure for the choking regime combustion. Then, this model is adopted for the hydrogen safety analysis for the Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) 1000. The hydrogen distribution is calculated with the mass and energy release obtained from severe accident analysis, from which, the most unfavorable ignition time and location is selected. The result of the CREBCOM model is compared with that of the turbulent flame closure model, which is a commonly used model for combustion analysis in containment safety. The results show that the CREBCOM model can provide a conservative prediction for the pressure and thermal load of combustion. Therefore, the CREBCOM model with the sonic flame assumption is applicable for the FA risk analysis in a local compartment for nuclear containments where a sonic deflagration cannot be safely excluded and manages to obtain a conservative pressure and thermal load for further evaluation on the containment integrity.""}"

The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of financial crisis on the level of CSR activities of firms in Nigeria and conceptually examine the behaviour of firms in implementing CSR activities in the time of financial crisis. Also, a survey was conducted to explore the impact of global financial crisis on firm’s implementation of CSR project in Nigeria using randomly selected oil firms. Data was generated through the use of questionnaires while descriptive statistics was employed in analysing date. The result shows that there is a significant decrease in CSR activities of firms in times of financial crisis However, was an overwhelming evidence of CSR strategic benefits to firms during crisis era. The study recommended further in-depth study on the effects of the global financial crisis.""}"

Primers with lower 10-MDP concentrations attain better outcomes. SUMMARY Objective: To assess the effects of different concentrations of 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (10-MDP) included in experimental ceramic primers on the degree of conversion (DC) and microshear bond strength (μSBS) of a dual-cure resin cement, and on the acidity neutralization potential of zirconia (ZrO2) in comparison to hydroxyapatite (HAp). Methods: Experimental ceramic primers were formulated using 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, or 40 wt% 10-MDP as an acidic functional monomer and camphorquinone (CQ)/amine or 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione (PPD) as a photoinitiator system. Clearfil Ceramic Primer (Kuraray Dental, Tokyo, Japan) was used as the commercial control. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was used to assess the DC of uncured and light-cured resin cements applied onto primer-treated ZrO2 surfaces. The μSBS and pH of primers were assayed in a universal testing machine and by a digital pH meter (Tec-3MP; Tecnal, Piracicaba, Brazil), respectively. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test (p&amp;lt;0.05). Results: DC was not affected until a concentration of 10% 10-MDP in CQ primer and 5% 10-MDP in PPD primer was reached, when compared with the positive control (p&amp;gt;0.05). Groups 10-MDP 5% in CQ and PPD primers showed the highest μSBS compared with the positive control (p&amp;gt;0.05); however, higher concentrations of 10-MDP induced significant DC and μSBS reduction (p&amp;lt;0.05). HAp neutralized 10-MDP primers, but ZrO2 provided higher acidity to the primers’ pH. Conclusion: 10-MDP monomer should be used in low concentrations in ZrO2 primers to avoid reduction of the polymerization and bond strength of resin cement.""}"

While the zebrafish orthologue exdpf is essential for exocrine pancreas specification, its importance for mammalian and human development has not been studied yet. We implemented a four times CRISPR/Cas9 nicking approach to knockout PPDPF in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and differentiated PPDPF KO/KO and PPDPF WT/WT cells towards the pancreatic lineage. In contrast to data obtained from zebrafish, a very modest effect of the knockout was observed in the development of pancreatic progenitors in vitro , not affecting lineage specification upon orthotopic transplantation in vivo . The modest effect is in line with the finding that genetic variants near PPDPF are associated with random glucose levels in humans, but not with type 2 diabetes risk, supporting that dysregulation of this gene may only result in minor alterations of glycaemic balance in humans. In addition, PPDPF is less organ- and cell type specifically expressed in higher vertebrates and its so far reported functions appear highly context-dependent.""}"

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) is the rate-limiting enzyme for FAO, and it is necessary to transport long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria. To define the role of tubular CPT1A in aging and injury, we generated mice with tubule-specific deletion of Cpt1a (Cpt1aCKO mice), and the mice were either aged for 2 years or injured by aristolochic acid or unilateral ureteral obstruction. Surprisingly, Cpt1aCKO mice had no significant differences in kidney function or fibrosis compared with wild-type mice after aging or chronic injury. Primary tubule cells from aged Cpt1aCKO mice had a modest decrease in palmitate oxidation but retained the ability to metabolize long-chain fatty acids. Very-long-chain fatty acids, exclusively oxidized by peroxisomes, were reduced in kidneys lacking tubular CPT1A, consistent with increased peroxisomal activity. Single-nuclear RNA-Seq showed significantly increased expression of peroxisomal FAO enzymes in proximal tubules of mice lacking tubular CPT1A. These data suggest that peroxisomal FAO may compensate in the absence of CPT1A, and future genetic studies are needed to confirm the role of peroxisomal β-oxidation when mitochondrial FAO is impaired.""}"

Measurements used included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, the Diet Quality Index, and the EORTC QLQ-C30. Results: Only twenty-six women (35.1%) met the American Cancer Society criteria of weekly PA, while most participants (93.2%) displayed good or excellent diet quality. Those less likely to meet the PA criteria were older women, women who had a lower economic level, and women not receiving anti-hormone therapy. However, there was no significant factor associated with diet quality. Women who met the criteria for PA displayed significantly better global QOL than women who did not meet the criteria. No significant differences were found in HRQOL between women who did and did not meet the diet quality criteria. Conclusion: Nurses should be aware of breast cancer survivors who are older and who have a low economic status when assessing and screening the level of PA to improve HRQOL.""}"

Preclinical, prospective, and retrospective studies were included. There is no published randomized controlled trials, evaluating the role of surgery in mPCa. Preclinical and retrospective data suggest benefit of primary tumor treatment in mPCa. Current literature supports the concept of cytoreductive surgery as it can prevent late symptomatic local progression, has acceptable complications, and may prolong survival in patients with mPCa. Surgery is a feasible procedure in mPCa which may improve outcome in mPCa. However, there is no Level 1 evidence, yet that support the role of surgery in mPCa.

Furthermore, there has been a recent resurgence in the clinical entry of new CDK inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. However, there are numerous other therapeutic applications where inhibition of cell proliferation and transcription with pharmacological CDK inhibitors might be useful. Chief amongst these are proliferative disorders in the areas of nephrology, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration.

It is shown that extrema that obey the period P W equaled 11.07(4) years retain the initial phase, which cannot be explained in terms of local physics and concepts of the past century regarding the mechanism of the solar cycle based on the theory of a magnetic dynamo and the phenomenological model of the Babcock-Leighton cycle. It is suggested that the cycle has a cosmic (cosmological) origin. This is clearly indicated by the correlation of the cycle period with a holographic time-scale of the Universe, (a 0 R 3)1/4/c ≈ 11.0(4) years, where a 0 and R are the radii of the first Bohr orbit of a hydrogen atom and the observable Universe, respectively, and c is the speed of light. It is noted that there are other strict holographic relations that include a 0, R, P W , the wavelength of the microwave background radiation (with a temperature of 2.7 K), and a period of the global solar pulsations equal to 9600.6 s. The true physical nature of the governing mechanism for the 11-year cycle can perhaps only be understood based on modern concepts about the nonlocality of our world, which follows from Bell's theorem, which is grounded on the achievements of quantum mechanics at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as using a model of a holographic Universe free of c.""}"

It explores the effect of a range of physiological stiffnesses on endothelial cell lineages. Tissue culture plastic, where endothelial cells are usually studied and cultured, have an elastic modulus of 106 kPa. This is orders of magnitude stiffer than the physiological stiffness, which is in the 0.1-100 kPa range. Therefore, it is important to study the effects of stem cell differentiation on more compliant stiffnesses suitable for the growth and proliferation of endothelial cells. The modifications are achieved through altering polyacrylamide matrix stiffness and seeding the stem cells on a Matrigel coating. Moreover, pluripotent stem cell derived endothelial cells have not been studied before on a continuous range of stiffness. In summary, the goals of this project are to develop a polyacrylamide stiffness protocol, explore the relationship of stiffness on endothelial cell differentiation, and evaluate the effect of specific stiffnesses on endothelial cell lineages. Five polyacrylamide stiffnesses were selected, human embryonic stem cells were seeded and induced to differentiate into endothelial cells. The qPCR results showcase that at the intermediate to high stiffnesses of C: 29.14 kPa and D: 66.01 kPa the cells upregulated more cardiac markers. Therefore, it is assumed that cells on these stiffnesses have differentiated from human embryonic stem cells into cardiac endothelial cells. This emphasizes the need for futher studies to investigate a finer polyacrylamide stiffness within that range in order to understand optimal cardiac endothelial cell substrate stiffness.--Author's abstract""}"

Unlike existing software, the new simulation tool is fully based on existing capabilities of PHREEQC without source code modifications or coupling to external software packages. Because of the direct integration, the full set of PHREEQC's geochemical reactions with connected databases for reaction constants is immediately accessible. Thus, unsaturated flow and solute transport can be simulated together with complex solution speciation, equilibrium and kinetic mineral reactions, redox reactions, ion exchange reactions and surface adsorption including diffuse double layer calculations. Liquid phase flow is solved as a result of element advection, where the Darcy flux is calculated according to Richards' equation. For accurate representation of advection-dominated transport, a total- variation-diminishing scheme was implemented. Dispersion was simulated with a standard approach; however, PHREEQC's multicomponent transport capabilities can be used to simulate species-dependent diffusion. Since liquid phase saturation is recalculated after every reaction step, biogeochemical processes that modify liquid phase saturation, such as dissolution or precipitation of hydrated minerals are considered a priori. Implementation of the numerical schemes for flow and solute transport have been described, along with examples of the extensive code verification, before illustrating more advanced application examples.

Its historical origins mark it as a response to the urban poor and its methodologies emerge from the impacts of industrialisation. This chapter reaches back to the philosophical beginnings of the profession and provides a colourful introduction to the symbiotic relationship between social work and the city, confronting the ambiguous positioning of the profession and its uncertain mandate. It makes reference to the Elizabethan Poor Law, to eighteenth-century philanthropy, to the Fabian Socialists who enumerated the city, and to interventions such as the Settlement Movement. Social work is a product of its time, its mileu and its context. It is also a product of dual loyalties to state and to the service user. This chapter considers this tension within the shifts and transformations from Social Darwinist residualist thinking to the doctrine of neo-liberalism and the impact on social work methodologies of the city. This notion is extended in several ways to engage critically with traditional tensions at the heart of the role of the social worker and how these require reworking in the face of opportunities within the modern city. Dilemmas and tensions of the professional role will be made explicit in redefining the place of 'urban social work'. This chapter proposes a number of competing visions of the city that shape ideas about the nature of urban social work. It argues for a repositioning of social work in relation to the contemporary city based on a reconnection with issues of place and space, scale, sustainability and new civic governance.""}"

Deforestation, which is still ongoing in Indonesia, has substantially reduced the habitat of NHPs in the republic. This has led to an intensification of interactions between NHPs and humans, which opens up the possibility of pathogen spillover. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of malarial parasite infections in NHPs in five provinces of Indonesia in 2022. Species of the genus Anopheles that can potentially transmit malarial pathogens to humans were also investigated. Methods An epidemiological survey was conducted by capturing NHPs in traps installed in several localities in the five provinces, including in the surroundings of a wildlife sanctuary. Blood samples were drawn aseptically after the NHPs had been anesthetized; the animals were released after examination. Blood smears were prepared on glass slides, and dried blood spot tests on filter paper. Infections with Plasmodium spp. were determined morphologically from the blood smears, which were stained with Giemsa solution, and molecularly through polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing using rplU oligonucleotides. The NHPs were identified to species level by using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 gene as barcoding DNA markers. Mosquito surveillance included the collection of larvae from breeding sites and that of adults through the human landing catch (HLC) method together with light traps. Results Analysis of the DNA extracted from the dried blood spot tests of the 110 captured NHPs revealed that 50% were positive for Plasmodium , namely Plasmodium cynomolgi , Plasmodium coatneyi , Plasmodium inui , Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium sp. Prevalence determined by microscopic examination of the blood smears was 42%. Species of the primate genus Macaca and family Hylobatidae were identified by molecular analysis. The most common mosquito breeding sites were ditches, puddles and natural ponds. Some of the Anopheles letifer captured through HLC carried sporozoites of malaria parasites that can cause the disease in primates. Conclusions The prevalence of malaria in the NHPs was high. Anopheles letifer , a potential vector of zoonotic malaria, was identified following its collection in Central Kalimantan by the HLC method. In sum, the potential for the transmission of zoonotic malaria in several regions of Indonesia is immense. Graphical Abstract""}"

This research was conducted by exploring Islamic views on the existence of the Prophet Muhammad's birthday (normative). The history and cultural optics of Islam in Aceh and in Arabia, especially those related to the traditions of the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, are also the objects of research in this research.

Methods: Potentially functional SNPs were selected using integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. The associations of 279 SNPs with chemotherapy response and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in 314 lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent PEM chemotherapy. Results: Among the SNPs investigated, 18 were significantly associated with response to chemotherapy, while 28 with OS. Of these SNPs, rs549794A&gt;G in an enhancer which is expected to regulate the expression of ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3) gene was significantly associated with both worse response to chemotherapy and worse OS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.36–0.97, p = 0.04; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.09–1.91, p = 0.01, respectively). Previous studies suggested that RPS3, a multi-functional protein with various extraribosomal activities, may play a role in chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it is postulated that rs549794-induced change in the expression level of RPS3 may affect the response to PEM chemotherapy and consequently the survival outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma patients. Conclusion: This study suggests that genetic variants in the histone modification regions may be useful for the prediction of clinical outcomes of PEM chemotherapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma.""}"

This randomized controlled trial was designed as a pre‐test, learning phase, and post‐test, followed by a one week delayed post‐test 2. The learning phase was two hours long, during which participants studied information from four Picmonic© visual mnemonics covering gastrointestinal pathology. Thirty‐two participants were assigned to one of four groups. A text group received only a paragraph summarizing the topics, and was instructed to use traditional study techniques (e.g., outlining). An image group used the Picmonic© image and summary text, and the Loci group studied the Picmonic© image and text using the Loci method. A control group took all three tests without going through the learning phase in order to measure the equivalency of the exams.

M i c h a e l H O E N Y A N S K Y / Brock University Jennifer Brady and W.H. Herendeen, Ben Jonson’s 1616 Folio (Newark: University of Delaware Press; London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1991). 221. $35.00 (U.S.) This collection of essays claims to offer a radical redefinition of Jonson’s art as fluid, his range and ordering of texts in the 1616 Folio contingent, marginal, and interdependent. In the attempt to counter “the more static, abstracted view of individual works that critics have generally held” (Intro­ duction, 14), the editors of this new critical volume have selected essays that reexamine the Folio as historical text, physical monument, literary/generic experiment, social signifier, and mid-career milestone. The common concern of the volume is its reassessment of Jonson’s classicism as a vital and inde­ pendent neoclassicism that comments more on the fluctuating early-modern values of Renaissance England than on idealizations of ancient Rome. The first pair of essays deal with aspects of the physical text. Kevin J. Donovan questions the authority of the Folio texts of individual works, and argues vigorously and convincingly for a reevaluation of quarto texts as authoritative for certain plays and masques. In disputing the preeminence of the Folio texts in Herford and Simpson’s 11-volume Ben Jonson, and in effect calling for a new and definitive edition of Jonson that takes recent bibliographic opinion into account (to which I can only add “Hear, hear!” ), Donovan clarifies the real and unique importance of the 1616 Folio: not as a monument to Jonson’s proofreading skills, but as a deliberate selection of works that invite reinterpretation of the meaning and reputation of liter­ ary/dramatic texts and their writers. W.H. Herendeen sets the pace in the second essay for such a reinterpretation by recognizing that the dedications of individual works in the Folio pay off past debts, rather than scrounge for new or continued patronage. He represents Jonsonian dedications as pro­ gressive declarations of the authority and independence of the poet himself, pointing to the fact that no dedication appears with the masques in the final 238 segment of the volume, nor at the head of the entire Folio itself, a clear sign that Jonson considered all debts paid in full, and all credit for the works his volume contains accruing to the artist alone. The next two essays focus on the drama from quasi-political perspectives. Katherine Maus describes the “satiric and ideal economies” Jonson creates in the Folio, arguing that the insatiable competitiveness among Jonson’s have and have-not materialists in the reductive world of his plays should not obscure the alternative transcendent economy of shared abundance Jonson celebrates in the poetry and masques. Maus is dazzling in her survey of supply and demand in the comedies, but in finally identifying Jonson with a Roman stoicism that finds merit only in hard-won results, she loses her economic balance to fall in with Edmund Wilson’s morose “anal-retentive” Jonson whose “costive” labour alone stamps his artistic production as gen­ uine. William Blissett’s discussion of the “Romanity” of three of the nine plays in the Folio (Poetaster, Sejanus, Catiline) takes a different tack in considering how far a classical education in Roman history, language, and literature permeates the Renaissance and modern consciousness. Blissett perhaps over-Romanizes by declaring that Jonson showed no similar interest in British history. What of the lost Robert II, those unidentified tragedies for which Francis Meres praised him, or indeed the increasingly explicit Englishness of the other six plays in the Folio? Of the two essays on the poetry, only Stella Revard continues the de­ bate on...""}"

Intrathecally administered neostigmine and neuronal nicotinic agonists are more potent in female than in male rats against acute thermal noxious stimuli. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is also a sex difference in the antiallodynic effects of intrathecal cholinomimetic agents in two models of allodynia and to test their pharmacologic mechanisms. Methods Male and female rats with indwelling intrathecal catheters received injections of neostigmine, bethanechol (muscarinic agonist), RJR-2403 (neuronal nicotinic agonist) alone or with atropine (muscarinic antagonist), mecamylamine (nicotinic antagonist), phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist), or saline control. The effect of these agents was determined on mechanical allodynia produced by either intraplantar injection of capsaicin or ligation of spinal nerves. Results Neostigmine and RJR-2403 but not bethanechol were more potent in female than in male rats in reducing allodynia after nerve injury, and antagonist studies were also consistent with a nicotinic component to explain this sex difference. Phentolamine did not reverse neostigmine's effect. In contrast, for capsaicin-induced allodynia, neostigmine plus mecamylamine but not neostigmine or RJR-2403 was more potent in female than in male rats. Conclusions These data demonstrate a sex difference of intrathecal neostigmine after nerve injury-induced allodynia similar to that observed in normal animals that received acute noxious thermal stimulation. However, this sex difference is not universal to all pain models because it was not present after intradermal capsaicin injection, nor is its interaction with spinal noradrenergic mechanisms consistent in all models.""}"

The data preprocessing steps include data cleaning, conversion, encoding, and segmentation. Model design involves selecting appropriate AI models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and explaining the reasons for the selection. Model training and validation are carried out through strategies such as parameter adjustment and cross validation to optimize model performance. The application of AI technology can enhance the sensitivity of medical services, reduce cost-effectiveness and processing time. The research results indicate that AI models perform well in sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and processing time, especially in applications with high real-time requirements such as medical image analysis. CNN has a sensitivity of up to 97%, a cost-effectiveness of only £590, and a processing time of up to 14ms.

However, in some patients, TFT results can be perplexing because the clinical picture is not compatible with the tests or because TSH and free T4 are discordant with each other. Optimizing the interpretation of TFTs requires a complete knowledge of thyroid hormone homeostasis, an understanding of the range of tests available to the clinician, and the ability to interpret biochemical abnormalities in the context of the patient's clinical thyroid status. The common etiologic factors causing puzzling TFT results include intercurrent illness (sick euthyroid syndrome), drugs, alteration in normal physiology (pregnancy), hypothalamic-pituitary diseases, rare genetic disorders, and assay interference. Sick euthyroid syndrome is the most common cause of TFT abnormalities encountered in the hospital. In hypothalamic-pituitary diseases, TSH levels are unreliable. Therefore, it is not uncommon to see marginally high TSH levels in central hypothyroidism. Drugs may be the culprit of TFT abnormalities through various mechanisms. Patients with inappropriate TSH levels need a differential diagnosis between TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma and resistance to thyroid hormone. Sellar magnetic resonance imaging, serum α-subunit levels, serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test, trial of somatostatin analogues, and TR-β sequencing are helpful for the diagnosis, but it may be challenging. TFTs should be interpreted based on the clinical context of the patient, not just the numbers and reference ranges of the tests, to avoid various pitfalls of TFTs and unnecessary costly evaluations and therapies.""}"

Indeed, when undertaking a proteomic study, the production of a suitable cellular extract is essential. Further isolation of subcellular fractions depends on the ability to rupture the animal tissues in such a manner that the organelle or macromolecule of interest can be purified in a high yield, free from contaminants and in an active form. The homogenization technique employed should, therefore, stress the cells sufficiently enough to cause the surface plasma membrane to rupture, thus releasing the cytosol; however, it should not cause extensive damage to the subcellular structures, organelles, and membrane vesicles. The extraction of proteins from animal tissues is relatively straightforward, as animal cells are enclosed only by a surface plasma membrane (also referred to as the limiting membrane or cell envelope) that is only weakly held by the cytoskeleton. They are relatively fragile compared to the rigid cell walls of many bacteria and all plants and are thus susceptible to shear forces. Animal tissues can be crudely divided into soft muscle (e.g., liver and kidney) or hard muscle (e.g., skeletal and cardiac). Reasonably gentle mechanical forces such as those produced by liquid shear may disrupt the soft tissues, whereas the hard tissues require strong mechanical shear forces provided by blenders and mincers. The homogenate produced by these disruptive methods is then centrifuged in order to remove the remaining cell debris.""}"

Das Modell wurde mit psychologischen, sozial- und wirtschaftswissenschaftlichen Theorien hinterlegt und somit eine konsistente Erklärungsbasis geschaffen. Nach mehreren Schritten zur Detaillierung und Reduktion der Komplexität entstand ein Simulationsmodell, welches in einem Simulationssystem implementiert wurde. Die damit durchgeführten Simulationsstudien haben gezeigt, dass Multiagentensimulation grundsätzlich gut geeignet ist, um Wissensweitergabe in Organisationen zu untersuchen. Das entwickelte Simulationssystem zeichnet sich durch leichte Erweiterbarkeit in der weit verbreiteten Programmiersprache Java aus, implementiert eine auf PECS und InterRaP basierende Agentenarchitektur und speichert die Simulationsergebnisse in einer relationalen Datenbank, sowie im Format einer freien Software für soziale Netzwerkanalyse.

Werden die Arbeitspakete in zufälliger Reihenfolge an den verfügbaren Mitarbeiter vergeben, bei dem der verfügbare Skill am wenigsten von dem erforderlichen abweicht, so steigt zwar der Unternehmenserfolg nicht signifikant, aber sowohl von Kollegen als auch durch Ausprobieren während der Projektarbeit wird signifikant mehr gelernt. Durch Dokumentation von Lernerfahrungen steigen Unternehmenserfolg und auch das gesamte Wissen aller Mitarbeiter signifikant. Interessant dabei ist insbesondere, dass Dokumentation auf persönlicher Ebene dazu führt, dass Mitarbeiter eher zu Spezialisten werden, also ein einzelnes Wissensgebiet vertiefen, während bei Dokumentation auf Teamebene das Generalistentum gefördert wird. Dies rührt daher, dass nicht in erster Linie aus dem dokumentierten Wissen, sondern bei der Projektnachbesprechung selbst gelernt wird, was zu breiterem Wissen und geringerem Vergessen führt, da viele Skills aktiviert werden.""}"

Complications due to shunt failure are associated with high morbidity and mortality. We report an analysis of risk factors for shunt failure in pediatric patients from a single institution in Nepal. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analytical study with prospective data was designed. All children younger than 15 years, with first time VP shunting, at a tertiary government hospital in Kathmandu during 2014-2017 were followed up. Association of independent variables with the primary outcome variable (complication of VP shunt) was analyzed using Chi-square test. Bivariate logistic regression was performed to identify unadjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Multivariate logistic regression model was designed to calculate adjusted OR with 95% CI. Results: Of 120 patients, more than half (55.8%) of the patients were male. Mean age was 62.97 months. Maximum duration of follow-up was 30 months. Most common cause of hydrocephalus was congenital aqueductal stenosis (40.8%) followed by tumors (29.2%). Overall shunt complication was found in 26.7% (95% CI 19.0%–35.5%). Shunt infection was seen in 5% while malfunction without infection was found in 21.7%. Bivariate logistic regression showed duration of surgery more than 1 h (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.11–6.42, P = 0.028) compared to 1 h or less, experienced surgeon (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16–0.89, P = 0.026) compared to residents, and emergency surgery (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.69–9.29, P = 0.001) compared to elective surgery as significant risk factors, while emergency surgery was the only significant variable for shunt failure on multivariate regression analysis (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.16–9.35, P = 0.025). Conclusion: Longer duration of surgery, less experience of the surgeon, and the priority of the case (emergency) were independent risk factors for shunt complications.""}"

On these surfaces the segment of the cross section that supports the load at the instant of rupture is seen distinctly, and its area can be measured. Normalizing breaking load by this area provides a breaking stress characteristic of the final supporting segment. “Ultimate” breaking stresses calculated in this way indicate (i) For notched filaments, the ultimate breaking stress is almost constant with notch depth and also with strain rate. (ii) For un‐notched filaments, there is an increase of breaking load with strain rate, due in part to the extent of the slow cleavage that precedes failure; however, the ultimate breaking stress increases as rate of strain decreases. These two findings are incompatible with mechanisms of failure based on growth of microcracks by heat‐ and stress‐activated chain breakage. A possible explanation involves rearrangement of microfibrils within the fiber which alters their strength distribution. (iii) The apparent strength reduction on wetting nylon filaments in water is due to a faster rate of growth of the slow‐cleavage area; the ultimate breaking stress is unchanged, except at high rates of strain.""}"

While the party’s defeat could be ascribed to conventional factors, including narratives of elite corruption linked to its leadership and internal factionalism; however, another significant factor that contributed to UMNO’s remarkable downfall was the cleavage structure that shifted away from the party which therefore eroded their political support. The article seeks to demonstrate the erosion of UMNO’s influence among the Malay electorates, particularly in its traditional strongholds of rural parliamentary constituencies in Peninsular Malaysia due to modifications in the cleavage structure. The analysis of the 2013, 2018, and 2022 general elections indicated that UMNO ceded votes to the Islamic party, PAS and the newly formed Malay party, BERSATU, which were partners of the Pakatan Harapan opposition coalition in 2018. The outcomes of the 2022 general elections revealed a further decline in support for UMNO among Malay electorates, attributed to the merger between PAS and BERSATU, to establish a perceived Malay-Muslim coalition in Perikatan Nasional. This article argues that UMNO lost its monopoly among the Malay electorates due to the strengthened convergence between the two cleavage structures of ethnicity and religion. The convergence was facilitated by UMNO's promotion of Islamisation, its normalisation of political cooperation with PAS, and the party’s inability to compete effectively with BERSATU which ended UMNO’s one-party dominance in Malaysia.""}"

La population d’étude est constituée de l’ensemble des personnes impliquées dans un accident corporel survenu en France entre 1996 et 2005 et impliquant au moins un conducteur de voiture. Le risque d’être impliqué dans un accident mortel dans quatre grandes catégories de situations de conduite a été estimé selon l’âge du conducteur. Puis le taux d’années de vie perdues ( avp ) attribué à chaque classe d’âge de conducteurs a été estimé pour chacune des situations de conduite. Par rapport aux conducteurs de 25-64 ans, les conducteurs âgés de 75 ans ou plus ont 16,7 fois plus de risque (IC 95 % = 15,1-18,5) d’être impliqué dans un accident mortel en traversée de voie(s), qu’être impliqués dans un tout autre accident. Toutefois, dans chaque situation de conduite, le taux d’ avp des autres impliqués baisse significativement lorsque l’âge du conducteur augmente. Les conducteurs âgés représentent donc une menace plus faible pour les autres usagers que les conducteurs plus jeunes. Des actions de sensibilisation aux dangers que chaque classe d’âge de conducteur fait courir aux autres usagers et une plus grande information sur les troubles liés au vieillissement devraient permettre une meilleure estimation des risques par la population.""}"

Analysis of the mouse TERT promoter revealed a potential NF-kappaB binding site 350 base pairs upstream from the translational start site. An oligonucleotide from this region of the TERT promoter bound to proteins in a nuclear extract prepared from a mouse hepatoma cell line. These proteins were identified as NF-kappaB by a number of criteria: 1) the protein complex formed on the TERT oligonucleotide had an electrophoretic mobility similar to that formed on an NF-kappaB consensus oligonucleotide; 2) protein binding to this site was enhanced by NF-kappaB activators tumor necrosis factor-alpha, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and interleukin-1beta; and 3) the complex was specific and could be supershifted with antibodies against the p50 or p65 NF-kappaB subunits. The NF-kappaB binding site from the mouse TERT promoter activated transcription when fused to a basal SV40 promoter and enhanced the activity of the native TERT promoter in mouse hepatoma cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Transcriptional activation by the TERT NF-kappaB site could also be enhanced by co-transfection with an NF-kappaB1 expression vector. NF-kappaB may therefore contribute to the activation of TERT expression observed in mouse tissue.""}"

The predicted outlet temperatures of the spray dryer model matched the experimental values very well over the entire range of spray dryer settings that were tested. Finally, the model was applied to produce glassy sugars by spray drying, an often used excipient in formulations of biopharmaceuticals. For the production of glassy sugars, the model was extended to predict the relative humidity at the outlet, which is not measured in the spray dryer by default. This extended model was then successfully used to predict whether specific settings were suitable for producing glassy trehalose and inulin by spray drying. In conclusion, a spray dryer model was developed that is able to predict the output parameters of the spray drying process.

Josefson1,*, Thomas L. Forbes1,**, Rutger Rosenberg2 1Department of Marine Ecology, National Environmental Research Institute, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark 2Department of Marine Ecology, Göteborg University, Kristineberg Marine Research Station, 450 34 Fiskebäckskil, Sweden *E-mail: aj@dmu.dk **Present address: Department of Biology, Adelphi University, Garden City, New York 11530, USA ABSTRACT: A 54 d incubation of intact sediment box-cores from 2 different macrofaunal sediment communities from the Swedish west coast was performed under controlled laboratory conditions in April to June 1999. One community was dominated by passive suspension feeders the other by subsurface deposit feeders. The box-cores were seeded with 14C-labelled detritus of the diatom Skeletonema costatum in order to mimic a post-spring-bloom situation. In addition to the labelled diatom phytodetritus, the box-cosms initially contained chlorophyll a with concentrations between 1 and 1.5 µg ml-1 in the top cm of the sediment. The experiment thus provided an opportunity to estimate degradation rates of the naturally occurring chlorophyll with a natural benthic fauna present over a ca. 2 mo period. Using a diagenetic model to describe the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a (chl a), and using the same, previously published, degradation rate constant in both communities (0.03 d-1), gave mixing coefficients (DB, cm2 d-1) that were on average >2 times higher in the community (L18) dominated by deposit feeders than in the suspension-feeding community (S3): 2.5 ± SD 1.7 and 0.86 ± SD 0.50, respectively. This indicates a higher mixing rate at L18. This difference in mixing between the 2 communities was supported by changes in vertical distribution of 14C-labelled phytodetritus over the 54 d period. The mixing coefficients ( DBs) were positively correlated with biomass of subsurface deposit feeders but not with total biomass. Background chl a was higher at L18 than at S3. A quantitative comparison of the total chl a inventories at the start and end of the experiment suggested a low overall degradation rate (no significant overall change) in the chl a, far from the reaction rate constant of 0.03 d-1 often used in the literature. Similarly, the total 14C activity in the cosms did not change significantly over the study period, suggesting a small loss of 14CO2 from the cosms relative to the 14C-pool size. The labelled algal matter distributions showed clear mixing over the 2 months in both communities with a higher mixing rate in the deposit-feeding community than the suspension-feeding community. Mixing also occurred deeper in the deposit-feeding community. Uptake of labelled matter by macrofauna was similar in the 2 communities, but differed markedly between species and trophic groups. At the end of the incubation, surface deposit feeders had an order of magnitude higher weight-specific 14C activity than suspension feeders and subsurface deposit feeders. The proportion of macrofaunal uptake of total 14C activity in the cosms was small, on the order of 5%. The results support the idea that community species composition is important for the fate of sedimented phytodetritus and that macrofaunal influence on degradation of sedimentary chlorophyll is small at this time of the year. The initial fate of the bloom material was burial in the sediment rather than consumption by heterotrophs. The findings are thus in accordance with the hypothesis that a part of the spring phytoplankton bloom may be buried for a while in the sediment before being remineralised.

From 2014 to 2016, a subset of the sample completed an additional survey that probed their overall interest in science and astronomy, where they reported getting information about science, and their judgment of those sources. Our sample of mostly nonscience major students outperformed the general public on basic science knowledge questions during the time of the study. Additionally, there was very little change over the range of time of the study in students’ basic science knowledge whose scores averaged around 79% correct over the 27 years. Students’ self-reported demographic information and beliefs and attitudes in science and technology accounted for only 11% of the variance in their science knowledge scores and there was no systematic pattern between where students reported getting their information about science and their basic science knowledge. Despite this, there was a relationship between how students rated the reliability of sources and their science knowledge. Our findings support that introductory astronomy courses are opportunities to improve students’ attitudes towards science and ability to evaluate scientific information. Although this group of students’ basic science knowledge and attitudes remained relatively unchanged over 27 years there was a measurable relationship between students’ beliefs and attitudes, interest, science knowledge, and information literacy.""}"

This exhibition has come to be regarded as a highly significant, indeed inaugural, museum showing of British conceptual art. The majority of its exhibitors were sculptors or had an affiliation to sculpture. The article charts how, through a series of compromises, the exhibition was realised. It examines the various agents who brought the exhibition into being, exploring the changing roles and priorities of artists, curatorial and other museum professionals. It considers changes in the museum as an institution, as works moved from temporary exhibition to permanent collection. It argues for this particular moment as one of marked porosity between the museum and gallery and between the world inside and outside the art institution. The article explores how what Boris Groys has termed ‘the museum-trained gaze’ was exercised in relation to a new body of art work and in relation to changing roles in the museum. The New Art was, it is argued, an exhibition where what was going on outside the exhibition was as interesting as what happened in the exhibition.""}"

We cannot operate with one theory of corruption per country, or region, or village, or “one-size-fits-all” approaches. General knowledge that is useful for anti-corruption policies must be applied according to the specific circumstances in each case. The social contract approach necessitates a dialogue between those who are doing basic research and those who are area or country specialists. Taking inspiration from military theorist Basil Liddell Hart’s indirect approach strategy, it is argued that decision makers should focus on policies that can change the basic social contract, instead of relying solely on measures that are intended to change incentives for corrupt actors. The indirect approach does not emphasize any single instrument, instead, the means depend on the case at hand. The main goal for the indirect approach is to change the opponent’s psychological willingness to resist change.""}"

A 2D k- $$\\varepsilon$$ turbulence model of ANSYS-FLUENT platform is used along with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model to track the interface between the water and vapor. The numerical findings indicate that HTC rises with a rise in mass flux and declines with a rise in heat flux. Furthermore, it is revealed that when heat flux rises, the VVF in the domain increases, corroborating the observation of a drop in HTC. The observed phenomenon is quite true for conventional tubes used in industries. An improvement in flow boiling HTC is also observed for tubes with higher surface roughness. The influence of inclination angle has substantial effect on the HTC, and the HTC rises with rise in inclination angle except for larger mass flux.

The cleanness and size of the 3D dark spot, the uniformity and strength of the light shell surrounding the dark spot, and the light efficiency all depend on the truncation parameter β of the R-LG(11) beam and the numerical aperture (NA) of the system.

If the NA is lowered but β is increased to 1.95, we can also achieve an almost 100% uniform light shell and light efficiency can reach 90%, but the disadvantage is that the center of the dark spot is not too clean. A not-too-clean 3D dark spot, if the light shell surrounding it is very uniform, is acceptable for many applications.

Robotic, but not laparoscopic, surgery significantly reduced 30-day mortality (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.37, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.16–0.84) and lowered conversion rates compared with laparoscopy (OR = 0.30, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] 0.22–0.40). Both robotic and laparoscopic approaches, compared with open surgery, were associated with reduced blood loss (-304 mL and -273 mL), fewer transfusions (OR 0.25 and 0.30), smaller transfused volumes (-1.98 and -1.86 units), shorter ICU stays (-4.0 and -2.3 days), fewer reinterventions (OR 0.45 and 0.56), and shorter hospital stays (-8.8 and -6.9 days). Conclusions: Robotic distal pancreatectomy appears safe and confers significant advantages over open and laparoscopic surgery, including reduced 30-day mortality, lower conversion rates, and improved perioperative outcomes, when performed in appropriately equipped, high-volume settings.""}"

The gas antisolvent (GAS) process is one of the promising techniques and has been applied to many applications. However, control of the GAS process is a quite challenging problem and has not yet been studied due to the complex liquid–vapor equilibrium and particle formation kinetics. This work proposes a batch-wise nonlinear model predictive control (BNMPC) approach to the GAS process to obtain the desired particle size distribution (PSD) of HMX, a widely used explosive, which should be small and uniform for stability. Although a dynamic model of the GAS crystallization is required for BNMPC, the previously developed model is too complex for real-time applications. We propose a model simplification strategy for the conventional model using experimental data. We also employ a high-resolution method (HRM) to solve effectively a partial differential equation (PDE). The simulation results show that BNMPC can produce more uniform and smaller HMX particles.""}"

The several geochemical models (Genex, Basimod, Matoil) in addition to Afta and Zafta Data show that regionaly significant heating event occured with maximum palaeo-temperature and maximum gas generation at 300 +/- 30 My. However, high palaeotemperatures can not be explained only by the significant burial. An important anomalous heat flow is needed to explain the geothermal history.

The effect of inclusion of passenger transfer penalty cost is seen to cause the optimum start and end points to move further away from the central business district (CBD). The validity and applicability of the model is tested using the existing Northwest to South light rail transit line in Calgary as a case study.""}"

Although more is known about dose-response relationships for ionizing radiation than for any other environmental carcinogen, estimates of cancer risk from low radiation doses have been extremely controversial; disagreements by factors of 100 or more are not uncommon. Direct estimation, based on data from populations exposed to low doses, is usually impracticable because of sample size requirements. Curve-fitting analyses, by which higher dose data determine lower dose risk estimates, require simple dose-response models if the estimates are to be statistically stable. The current level of knowledge about biological mechanisms of carcinogenesis dose not usually permit the confident assumption of a simple model, however; thus frequently the choice is between unstable risk estimates obtained using general models and statistically stable estimates whose stability depends on arbitrary model assumptions.""}"

In greenhouse tests, mechanically inoculated plants of Cucurbita pepo (Small Sugar pumpkin and Early Prolific Straightneck squash) and watermelon (Crimson Sweet) developed mosaic or mottle symptoms. Isolate 2932 caused foliar symptoms in 16 cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, including Freedom II and Prelude II, and in six cultivars of watermelon. None of five cultivars of melon (Cucumis melo) or 11 cultivars of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) developed consistent, distinctive symptoms, but all of these cultivars were systemically infected based on back-inoculations to squash. No systemic infection of mechanically inoculated plants of 25 species representing 13 noncucurbitaceous plant families was detected. Crystalline nuclear inclusions, cytoplasmic amorphous inclusions, and cytoplasmic cylindrical inclusions were detected by light and electron microscopy in leaf tissues of infected squash and watermelon. Electron microscopy of squash leaf extracts revealed filamentous particles, and 86% of 159 particles measured ranged from 800 to 890 nm in length. The virus was transmitted in a nonpersistent manner by Myzus persicae from squash to squash in two of three trials. Immunodiffusion tests with polyclonal antisera prepared to partially purified 2932 or its capsid protein showed that the isolate was antigenically different from papaya ringspot virus type W, watermelon mosaic virus 2, and zucchini yellow mosaic virus. In limited testing of field samples of squash and watermelon since 1990, no additional isolates of the 2932 type have been found. The characteristics of isolate 2932 obtained thus far indicate that it is a distinct potyvirus. It is tentatively named watermelon leaf mottle virus to distinguish it from other potyviruses commonly isolated from cucurbits in Florida.""}"

Reduction of androgen levels in Sprague-Dawley rats by castration inhibited the expression of a large set of miRs in prostate and muscle, which was reversed by treatment of castrated rats with 3 mg/day dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or selective androgen receptor modulators. Knockout of the miR processing enzyme, DICER, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells or tissue specifically in mice inhibited AR function leading to AIS. Since the only function of miRs is to bind to 3' UTR and inhibit translation of target genes, androgens might induce miRs to inhibit repressors of AR function. In concordance, knock-down of DICER in LNCaP cells and in tissues in mice induced the expression of corepressors, NCoR and SMRT.

It seems that swing of ancient times spread across the country after customs from nomadic tribes of the northern regions of China in the Warring States Period were passed on to central areas through the Qi state. As it reached Middle Age society, swing made their appearance as visual amusement for the emperor and honors of the royal court and as art of high quality was added, it was presented extravagantly. In particular, swing aspects of the Song Dynasty Era were not those of the single event swing shown in ancient societies, but part of song, dance, leisure, and performance. In pre-modern societies(the Ming and Qing Dynasties), swing were further popularized and homes installed pillars for swing regardless of wealth or region and enjoyed them. Also, with the inflow of Western swing, arts of high degrees of difficulty were demanded and swing that were traditional amusements of the Qīngmíng Festival became more than traditional amusements and transitioned into something that could be enjoyed even on days that were not holidays.BR With the coming of modern society, swing transitioned from traditional amusement to sports events. In this process, ethnic Koreans living in China making efforts to pass on the traditional form of amusement, traditional athletics competitions of minority groups, and national efforts helped swing to be passed on and developed. Today, as social demand for the continuance of traditional culture is becoming greater, the fact that swing have continued in their existence from China until now implies many things. Also, it is hoped that this will be a foundation for future studies that discover similarities in amusements of Northeast Asian countries and that search for the significance of such exchange aspects.""}"

Most systematic studies of this thesis investigate whether recombination is associated with the creation of high-impact technologies. This study looks at novelty in markets, investigating the association between recombination and venture capital investment. Acknowledging that people use different categories in different contexts, the author argues that the evaluator’s categorical system is foundational to what is recognized and rewarded as recombination. Supporting this view, findings show that venture capitalists are more likely to invest in software entrepreneurs that engage in recombination across market categories, but standard measures of recombination across technological categories (based on patent classes) are not associated with investment. In addition, whether a person values recombination depends on his orientation toward disrupting the status quo. In line with this, it is high and low status VCs who are more likely to invest in firms that engage in recombination. In syndicates comprised of middle status investors only, the direction of the effect reverses.

However, once death has occurred there is an expectation that the family will organise a funeral that reflects the character, life and personality of the deceased. Simultaneously with the disempowerment of individuals in the face of death a range of professionals has emerged, such as funeral directors and funeral officiants, who can guide families through the post-death maze, and ensure that a suitably personalised funeral is organised. This chapter suggests that the disempowerment of families in the face of bereavement is a consequence of contemporary death management practices, but that it is not a necessary consequence. Conceptualising death management as composed of two separate strands reveals spaces where families can regain control if they so wish. The first such strand is that of systems of death management, and this is composed of the requirements that a society imposes, such as death registration and certification. Those who choose to ignore such requirements do so under the threat of potentially severe consequences to themselves. The second strand is that of situated death management, and these are the processes whose flouting carries not a legal but a social consequence. The decision to hold a non-religious funeral, for example, may arouse disapproval amongst the wider kin and friendship group. The chapter illustrates how the two strands of death management may work in practice through reference to a Scottish case study.""}"

Furthermore, the spectrogram ridge point extraction for the existing methods is limited to the assumption of the constant or close to constant frequency in local windows while many application cases may not follow this assumption. In this paper, an iterative demodulation and chirp spectrogram (Chirogram) combined technique is proposed to perform PCT and solve these two issues. Simulation test results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the energy concentration and estimation accuracy of instantaneous frequencies for noisy signals.""}"

Analysis of the dopamine content in the striatum did not show any significant change after EA. In situ hybridization showed that high frequency EA stimulation up-regulated the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mRNA in both sides of the globus pallidus, while low frequency EA only affected the unlesioned side.

Zipes states that it is impossible to provide any date or, for that matter, any approximation of a date for the “birth” of the fairy tale, a genre which depends on “the symbiotic relationship of oral and literary currents.” This leads to an exploration of the origins of human communication in which it is argued that all narratives are driven by the urge to be in power, to be relevant and are hence elitist. It is emphasised that the precursors of fairy tales related to belief systems, represented shared experience preserved in the oral tradition. Tracing themes of conflict, notably as they cast a light on the dark side of human life, Zipes cautiously points to Sumerian precursors and then pays full attention to the Greek fables attributed, rightly or wrongly, to Aesop (c. 600 b. C.). He sees fables as stories of animals involved in human conflicts and he tries to identify fairy tale elements. He goes in depth concerning the literary versions of Puss-in-boots from the 16th and 17th centuries the origins of which reach back to India. Employing Richard Dawkins’s theory of memes (a meme being a unit in cultural transmission), Zipes suggests that fairy tales are created out of pools of memes and are instruments used to preserve instinctual morality in changing environments. The French term conte de fées, “fairy tale,” was coined by Baroness d’Aulnoy for stories she wrote and narrated in the salons of Paris in 1690-1710. She recycled much material that existed both in the oral tradition as well as in literature and Roman-Greco myths and tales. So did her contemporaries, mostly women who appropriated narratives involving fairies and other fantastic beings in alternate worlds outside the confines of the state and the church which, in their tales, were portrayed as weak. It is argued that the spectacles of Italian opera exerted some influence on the fantastic narratives, and Zipes refers to d’Aulnoy’s own life (and those of many other women) for the importance of midwives, nannies as real-life fairies who were of paramount importance as protectors of girls and women in many cultures. Homing in on the French author Charles Perrault’s Bluebeard, Zipes notes that this story, possibly the first written narrative about a serial killer, has a life of its own and is more well-known than the author. Elements from the story had been circulating long before 1695. It has been remade thousands of times both in literature and in other media. Zipes sees this as “part of a discursive process of remakings within the larger genre of the fairy tale.” In the same fashion that tales should be understood in their contemporary context, remakes should be so too. This is illustrated in a discussion of the French director Catherine Breillat’s Bluebeard (2009). It is concluded that whereas the first tale bears the imprint Perrault’s personality, experience and age, Breillat subtly changes Perrault’s male dominance and female curiosity in her film. Retellings of the theme will continue to be made as long as there are serial killers but they will also reflect changed mores. Zipes turns attention to the nature of fairies and witches. He considers them as the mimetic seeds spread by pagan goddesses that have been transformed into benevolent and malevolent powers by misogynistic cultural processes. With an excursus on the Russian narrologist Vladimir Propp in which Zipes emphasises that Propp’s research was never subject to Soviet censorship, he homes in on the Slavonic, specifically Russian character of Baba Yaga.

However, the development of switching-level simulation model for the actual size BTB Converter is very difficult because the MMC normally has more than 150 sub-modules for each arm. So, a switching level simulation model for the 11-level MMC-based BTB converter was developed with PSCAD/EMTDC software, which has 12 sub-modules for the positive arm and another 12 sub-modules for the negative arm. The DC-voltage balance algorithm, the circulating-current reduction algorithm, the harmonic reduction algorithm, and the redundancy operation algorithm were included in this simulation model. The developed simulation model can be utilized to analyze the MMC-based BTB converter for HVDC application in switching level and to develop the protection scheme for the MMC-based BTB converter for HVDC application.""}"

Experimentally measured joint positions and floor-reaction force enabled us to calculate joint torque during motion along several paths by using the Newton-Euler formulation. And we evaluated the supporting performance of the paths of a machine arm. These calculations indicate that a linear interpolating path minimizes the necessary joint torque for assisting standing-up or sitting-down motion.

For this, friend and foe must have distinguishable characters and the organism must both detect these characters, and know which characters are likely to associate with non-danger (friend) and which characters are likely to associate with danger (foe). After this discrimination, there must then be a response (either non–alarm, or alarm) that, in turn, would lead to a variety of other responses of an adaptive nature (e.g. escape from, or destroy, the foe).""}"

Methods— Four hundred eighty-nine acute stroke patients were included and followed up with assessments of 16 prespecified complications during the first week. Two hundred forty-four of the patients were randomly allocated to a 3-month follow-up. Results— During the first week, 312 of 489 patients (63.8%) experienced 1 or more complications. The most common complications were pain in 117 patients (23.9%), temperature ≥38°C in 116 (23.7%), progressing stroke in 90 (18.4%), urinary tract infection in 78 (16.0%), troponin T elevation without criteria of myocardial infarction in 57 (11.7%), chest infections in 55 (11.2%), nonserious falls in 36 (7.4%), and myocardial infarction in 22 (4.5%), whereas stroke recurrence, seizure, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, shoulder pain, serious falls, other infections, and pressure sores were each present in ≤2.5% of patients. During the 3-month follow-up, 201 of 244 patients (82.4%) experienced at least 1 complication, the most common of which was pain, which occurred in 134 patients (53.3%), followed by urinary tract infection in 68 (27.9%) and nonserious falls in 61 (25.0%). The severity of stroke on admission was the most important risk factor for developing complications. Conclusions— This is the first study of complications in unselected acute stroke patients treated in a comprehensive stroke unit and early supported discharge service and shows that pain, progressing stroke, infections, myocardial infarction, and falls are common complications, whereas others occur infrequently. Most complications occur during the first 4 days, and stroke severity is the most important risk factor.""}"

One significant barrier to efficacy may be the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) into the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrate functional inhibition of MDSC with IPI-145, an inhibitor of PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ isoforms, which enhances responses to PD-L1 blockade. Combination therapy induced CD8+ T lymphocyte–dependent primary tumor growth delay and prolonged survival only in T-cell–inflamed tumor models of head and neck cancers. However, higher doses of IPI-145 reversed the observed enhancement of anti-PD-L1 efficacy due to off-target suppression of the activity of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes.

Sixteen out of a total of 70 surveyed sites were situated below 200 m and their restriction to unenclosed land suggests that low elevation hummocks might have been more widespread prior to cultivation. There is clear evidence to indicate that these hummocks have developed within historical times, some within the last 150 years or so. An analysis of site characteristics and distribution favours a frost origin. Their development does not appear to be restricted to the 'Little Ice Age' but rather to any period or 'window' in which sufficiently cold conditions allow frost to exploit sites with properties conducive to frost penetration. It is suggested that features formed under such conditions might be termed 'pseudo-periglacial' to distinguish them from true periglacial landforms. EARTH hummocks are small, generally round to ovoid mounds which can vary in size up to 2 m in diameter and 0o5 m in height. They usually occur as extensive groupings, a fact which gives rise to the term 'hummocky microrelief' (Fig. IA). Individual mounds consist of mineral soil, with or without a core boulder, which is covered by a mat of vegetation usually differing, in terms of the species present, from the 'mesh' or areas between and around the hummocks. Turf hummock describes a mound that consists wholly of vegetable material. Although some hummocks have been explained differently, for example as anthills (Schreiber, 1965), most are now thought to result from some form of frost action. There is little previous mention of the occurrence of earth hummocks within the United Kingdom. Tufnall (1975) suggests that this apparent scarcity could either indicate a genuine rarity or, alternatively, point to such microfeatures having simply failed to attract the attention of field scientists. With their observations of Pleistocene earth hummocks on Dartmoor, Te Punga (1956) and Waters (1962) were the first to draw attention to the development of such features within the United Kingdom. Subsequently, earth hummocks have been recorded near the top of great Dun Fell in the northern Pennines (Tufnall, 1975) and in North Wales and Scotland (Ball and Goodier, 1970). In terms of their distribution the more recent observations share two important characteristics. In each case the earth hummocks are restricted to higher altitudes and they have been forming recently. A recent origin is generally favoured as such small-scale features are unlikely to have survived intact since the Pleistocene in the seasonally severe climatic conditions experienced at such altitudes. Earth hummocks are certainly forming today, both in subarctic regions and at high altitudes in mid-latitudes. Such hummocks are the product of frost action and are classified by Washburn (1973) as a special type of non-sorted net. The exact mechanisms of frost formation are somewhat obscure. Lundquist (1969) in agreeing with Beskow (1935) favours two possible origins. In the first, local unevenness of the ground-surface and vegetation results in patches of thicker vegetation which protect the underlying mineral soil from frost penetration so that the surrounding soils become frozen first and, in penetrating under the enclosed unfrozen patch, 487 This content downloaded from 207.46.13.52 on Sat, 22 Oct 2016 05:52:46 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms""}"

Based on the findings of ethnographer Wilbur Zelinsky, the paper assumes that gravestones in particular record very private, innermost feelings, messages, tidings, and personal values, which can provide us with important knowledge about (especially) the bereaved persons’ attitudes to human ultimate things including religious issues in the moments of a great loss of a loved one, i.e. in the situation of so-called existential crisis. The aim of the paper is to answer two key questions: firstly, how religion (or non-belief) is presented in the Czech national cemetery and secondly, to what degree is the gravestones’ character influenced by significant historical events of modern Czech history. In other words, how much the image of religion in this nationally important cemetery corresponds with the degree of religiosity researched by standard sociological means.""}"

The overall reaction sequence is shown in Fig. 1. In the first step (the coupling reaction) phenylisothocyanate (PITC) reacts with the N-terminal amino group of the peptide or protein. The sample is then dried and treated with an anhydrous acid (e.g., trifluoracetic acid), which results in cleavage of the peptide bond between the first and second amino acid. The N-terminal amino acids is therefore released as a derivative (the thiazolinone). The thiazolinone is extracted into an organic solvent, dried down, and then converted to the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative (the conversion step). The PTH amino acid is then identified, normally by reverse-phase HPLC. This is known as the direct Edman degradation and is, for example, the method used in an automated sequencing machine. The dansyl-Edman method for peptide sequencing described here is based on the Edman degradation, but with the following modifications. Following the cleavage step the thiazolinone is extracted, but rather than being converted to the PTH derivative it is discarded. Instead, a small fraction (5%) of the remaining peptide is taken and the newly liberated N-terminal amino acid determined in this sample by the dansyl method (see Chapter 35 ).""}"

Certain project delivery models (PDMs) with strong emphasis on relationships and trust are especially suited to value co-creation approach by encouraging collaborations amongst stakeholders and innovations. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that value co-creation impacts positively on particular types of projects but not on others. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of value co-creation on project performance (PP) and how the effect is moderated by requirements uncertainty (RU). Design/methodology/approach Based on the data from a cross-sectional survey of 120 Chilean construction project managers, the study validated a conceptual framework on the moderated effects of value co-creation process. Findings Value co-creation process underpinned through relational engagement, collaboration and innovativeness positively impacts on PP, and project’s RU moderates this relationship. Practical implications The findings empirically show that collaborative PDMs are best suited to projects where requirements are uncertain. Identifying the most suitable delivery model for a given context can reduce the project’s risk of failure and help maximise project value. When RU is low, the co-creating value is less critical to PP; whereas, when RU is high, choosing a collaborative PDM is fundamental to superior PP. Originality/value This study provides much-needed evidence on the effects of value co-creation process on PP. Additionally, it contributes to the literature by conceptualising and validating the moderated impact on PP by RU.""}"

Mathematical models that simulate future HIV incidence projections help evaluate the impact of interventions and inform intervention decisions. However, current models are either national-level, which do not consider jurisdictional-heterogeneity, or independent jurisdiction-specific, which do not consider cross jurisdictional interactions. Data suggests that significant proportion of persons have sexual-partnerships with persons outside their own jurisdiction. However, the sensitivity of these jurisdictional interactions on model outcomes and intervention decisions have not been studied. Methods : We developed a compartmental simulation of HIV in the U.S., through composition of 57 EHE and 46 non-EHE jurisdictions, with populations interacting across jurisdictions through sexual partnerships. To evaluate sensitivity of jurisdictional interactions on model outputs, we analyzed 16 scenarios, combinations of proportion of sexual-partnerships mixing outside jurisdiction: no-mixing, low-level-mixing-within-state, high-level-mixing-within-state, or high-level-mixing-within-and-outside-state; jurisdictional-heterogeneity in care and demographics: homogenous or heterogeneous; and intervention assumptions for 2019-2030: baseline or EHE-plan (diagnose, treat, and prevent). Results : Change in incidence in mixing compared to no-mixing scenarios varied by EHE and non-EHE jurisdictions and aggregation-level. When assuming jurisdictional-heterogeneity and baseline-intervention, while the change in aggregated incidence ranged from -2% to 0% for EHE and 5% to 21% for non-EHE, within each jurisdiction it ranged from -31% to 46% for EHE and -18% to 109% for non-EHE. Thus, incidence estimates were sensitive to jurisdictional-mixing more at the jurisdictional-level. As a result, jurisdiction-specific HIV-testing intervals inferred from the model to achieve the EHE-plan were also sensitive, e.g., when no-mixing scenarios suggested testing every 1 year (or 3 years), the three mixing-levels suggested testing every 0.8 to 1.2 years, 0.6 to 1.5 years, and 0.6 to 1.5 years, respectively (or 2.6 to 3.5 years, 2 to 4.8 years, and 2.2 to 4.1 years, respectively). Similar patterns were observed when assuming jurisdictional-homogeneity, however, change in incidence in mixing compared to no-mixing scenarios were high even in aggregated incidence. Conclusions : Accounting for jurisdictional-mixing and jurisdictional-heterogeneity could help improve model-based analyses.""}"

Получены оценки характеристик предлагаемой модели. Introduction. In various areas of human activities (medicine, technology, etc.), there are quasiperiodic processes. Their study and analysis require adequate statistical simulation models. The properties of theoretical models, for instance, the typical Gaussian random process, usually do not fit the processes in question. Thus, it is imperative to build models by the observed implementations of the processes. The aim of the research was to study the possibilities of application of Markov model for modeling differential rhythmogram. It seems rather promising to apply simple Markov model of a random process, which transition probability matrix contains a large number of parameters that can be estimated by the received process implementations. Conclusions. The model allows to display a variety of statistical and correlation properties. It is enabled to integrate estimates of the transition probabilities of the model by the onetype implementations of the random processes. Markov model can be employed in problems of classification of random processes by observed implementations. Analysis of the time properties (rhythmograms) of quasiperiodic processes and their modeling is conveniently carried out with the use of differences of adjoint periods (differential rhythmograms).""}"

Such an analysis was conducted through text mining computational methods, including sentiment analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and topic modeling. The results revealed that although HF users employ average vocabulary diversity, they share more positive emotions, and a greater variety of emojis. They also tended to discuss different topics, from more spiritual and health-related subjects to more practical matters related to work and success. Finally, they generally wrote from an empathetic state of mind, caring about people’s day-to-day feelings and about the world.""}"

In the 1980s and 1990s, seminal radical nationalist thinkers, including James Mason, William Pierce, Louis Beam, Tom Metzger, and David Lane, incorporated lone wolf violence as part of decentralized revolutionary tactics, often, although not exclusively, named “leaderless resistance.” Contemplating the fact that White racist organizations, including the Ku Klux Klan, had not been able to safeguard the privileges, resources, and powers long attached to Whiteness by US law, Mason, Pierce, Beam, Metzger, and Lane concluded that White racist organizations not only were too dysfunctional but also far too visible, and therefore easy to monitor, infiltrate, and neutralize. While the White nationalist cause still needed public figures and organizations to attract and educate new cadres, armed White racist resistance had to be decentralized and leaderless. White nationalist leaders should issue generalized calls to arms but give no direct orders and have no knowledge about who was planning to do what. The perpetrators would themselves be responsible for preparing and executing their violent crime and securing adequate resources. The lone wolf should go under the radar and melt into the general population by avoiding racist organizations and attributes and should never tell anyone about his—White racist lone wolves are so far predominantly male—opinions and activities. The perpetrator would risk his life or freedom but be awarded heroic status in the White nationalist hall of fame. To White nationalist leaders, the tactics are cost effective. Should the lone wolf succeed, the violence would benefit the cause; should he fail, he could bring down no one. During the Internet age, the lone wolf tactics spread through viral marketing and globalized media throughout what White nationalists call the “once White world” in America, Europe, South Africa, and Oceania. The tactics had by then evolved into two schools or types of lone wolves: the lone racist serial offender, who seeks to avoid getting caught and operates in the shadows for an extended period of time; and the mega-impact lone wolf, who wants to get everyone’s attention by one sensational attack, in which the perpetrator is more likely to die or get caught during, or immediately after, the big assault—a sacrifice that is likely to increase the fame of the perpetrator. Both lone wolf types count on the media to amplify their impact and heroic status, and to spread the message of the White revolution to which lone wolves seek to contribute. Lone wolves inspire copycats, and the number of attacks escalated during the first decades of the new millennium. In early 2020, the increase of lone wolf violence was interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, as restrictions closed attackers’ favorite targets, for example, mosques, synagogues, churches, and schools, and imposed curfews and banned public gatherings.""}"

The authors of the present study previously reported that abnormal upregulation of lncRNA DQ786243 (lncDQ) was associated with poor prognoses for patients with HCC. However, the elucidation of underlying mechanisms which influenced these results was not completed. Thus, the current study aimed to characterize the mechanisms and functions of lncDQ that facilitate its promotion of HCC progression. lncDQ, miR‑15b‑5p and Wnt3A expression levels were characterized in HCC and portal vein tumor thrombus tissue samples and for liver cancer and liver cancer cell lines using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Bioinformatics software was used for the analysis of interactions between lncDQ and miR‑15b‑5p, miR‑15b‑5p and Wnt3A. Luciferase assays confirmed the binding relationships between miR‑15b‑5p and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of Wnt3A. Using online databases, prognostic values of miR‑15b‑5p and Wnt3A were also assessed. Proliferation and invasion assays were used to assess liver cancer and HCC cell functions after individually silencing lncDQ and miR‑15b‑5p expression in the cells. Western blotting was used for the investigation of alterations of the expression of Wnt3A/β‑catenin and epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT) signal pathways. lncDQ and Wnt3A expression were significantly increased in HCC tissues, whereas miR‑15b‑5p was downregulated in HCC tissues. Low expression of miR‑15b‑5p was also associated with poor prognoses for patients with HCC. lncDQ was able to bind with miR‑15b‑5p and served as a competing endogenous RNA. As the target gene of miR‑15b‑5p, Wnt3A was correlated with poor prognoses for patients with HCC. Silencing of lncDQ expression significantly attenuated proliferation and invasion of liver cancer and HCC cells, however the inhibition of miR‑15b‑5p was able to reverse this effect. However, silencing of lncDQ and miR‑15b‑5p expression simultaneously resulted in the partial rescue of the inhibitory effect in the liver cancer and HCC cells. lncDQ inhibited miR‑15b‑5p so as to promote HCC cell invasion and proliferation through activation of the Wnt3A/β‑catenin/EMT pathway. Taken together, the results of the present study suggested that the lncDQ/miR‑15b‑5p axis modulates the progression of HCC.""}"

The pandemic H3N2 virus A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (HK68) possessed only two glycosylation sites on the HA globular head at residues 81 and 165. In 1975 and 1999, periods of significant antigenic change, H3N2 IAV acquiredglycans at residues 63 and 126 (HK68+2) and residues 63, 126, 133, and 246(HK68+4), respectively. Differences in receptor binding, pathogenicity, and induction of T‐cell‐mediated immunopathology in mice between the HK68 and its glycosylation variants have previously been demonstrated. Here, we evaluated the consequences of this incremental glycosylation on antibody responses directed to HA. Total serum antibody titers against HA were measured 15 days after infection of mice with 10 5 TCID 50 of each virus by hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) with various red blood cells (RBC) at room temperature (RT). The avidity was measured at 37°C. Sera from mice infected with any virus showed reactivity against all tested HAs. However, sera from mice infected with HK68 and HK68+2 (lower glycosylation) demonstrated relatively low reactivity against higher glycosylated HK68+4. Sera from HK68+4‐infected mice recognized all tested HAs at similar levels. Viral pathogenicity did not correlate with antibody titers or avidity, since moderate titers and avidity were observed with viruses of highest and lowest pathogenicity (HK68 and HK69+4 respectively), while higher titers and avidity were seen in sera of mice infected with HK68+2, whose pathogenicity is intermediate between HK69 and HK68+4. The data suggest that HA antibody responses may be influenced by HA glycan composition in ways that are unconnected to pathogenicity. Modification of N ‐linked glycosylation of the HA globular head may present a new approach for improvement of IAV vaccine efficacy.""}"

A group of children in a respite care program previously diagnosed with ADHD and medicated by paediatricians, serve to illustrate these issues.""}"

As shown by the 2020 New Pact on Migration and Asylum, the Agency enjoys strong political support for its integrated management of the external borders of the EU Member States. In particular, Frontex can carry out joint maritime, land and air operations and forced removals, in addition to deploying agents in third countries. In 2021, a permanent contingent of the European Border and Coast Guard with enforcement powers will be established. We argue that this unprecedented reinforcement of Frontex’s powers reflects the preference of the EU and its Member States to respond to migratory pressure primarily by securitizing their borders in order to deter unwanted migrants. This approach is not only counterproductive but also leads to serious violations of the rights of migrants, including asylum seekers. Despite some changes in the Agency's mandate to improve the rights' protection framework the lack of clear rules for the determination of Frontex's responsibility in joint operations and the absence of an effective remedy for rights violations remain particularly problematic.&lt;/p&gt;""}"

The results showed that the aims of immersive journalism are: experience events, increase emotional aspects, high-quality display, embodiment and first-person experience. The major benefits that immersive journalism brings are: exclusive access, closing distance, spatial storytelling, presence and viewer agency. The appropriate genres for immersive journalism are: VR- live videos, VR News and VR documentaries.

Along with engineering and administrative measures, usage of personal protective equipments (PPE) by the workers is equally important in protecting the workers. However a high level of non-compliance to PPE usage among the workers is commonly noted. South India has several foundries, giving employment to many workers. The objectives of the study were to find out the level of PPE usage among the foundry workers, before and after an interventional program and to assess the relative effectiveness of different strategies of the program in bringing out the improved PPE compliance among them. Materials and methods: After obtaining ethical clearance, the study was conducted among 78 permanent workers of a foundry in Coimbatore.&nbsp; First the demographic details of the subjects and their level of usage of PPE were recorded, in the pre-test. Then a comprehensive three faceted interventional program, consisting of strategies such as health education to the workers, peer motivation by co-workers, and posters in the working environment, was implemented simultaneously among all subjects. After three months of implementation of the program, the post-test was conducted and the data were analyzed to measure the effectiveness of the intervention.&nbsp; Results: After the interventional program, the workers showed significant improvement in PPE usage (p&lt;0.001) from the ‘pre-test’ level. Regarding their perception about which of the three strategies relatively contributed to bring out the improvement, most of the workers rated the strategy of peer motivation as ‘high’ effectiveness, health education- ‘average’ effectiveness and posters in working environment- ‘low’ effectiveness. Conclusion: Interventional program using multiple strategies in an integrated manner has synergistically enhanced the behaviour change among the workers.""}"

Dexamethasone caused concentration- and time-dependent decreases in 125 I–[Sar 1 ,Ala 8 ]Ang II binding that were prevented by glucocorticoid receptor inhibition with mifepristone. A lag time of 24 hours and a dexamethasone concentration of at least 10 nmol/L were necessary for this effect to occur. Dexamethasone-induced reduction of 125 I–[Sar 1 ,Ala 8 ]Ang II binding resulted from decreased Ang II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor density. No change in the apparent dissociation constant was observed. Dexamethasone also markedly inhibited Ang II–dependent inositol phosphate accumulation. Both reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis using specific short probes from the 3′ noncoding region of the cDNA demonstrated the presence of AT 1A and AT 1B receptor mRNAs in rat mesangial cells, with a slight predominance of AT 1B . Therefore, we studied the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of these two subtypes in rat mesangial cells. Dexamethasone produced a time-dependent decrease of AT 1B receptor mRNA that was apparent after 6 hours of incubation, whereas AT 1A receptor mRNA did not change. Mifepristone also suppressed the dexamethasone-induced decrease in AT 1B receptor mRNA. In conclusion, glucocorticoids diminish Ang II receptor density at the mesangial cell surface through a mechanism that implies successive interaction with the glucocorticoid receptor and specific reduction in AT 1B receptor mRNA expression. This differential regulation of both AT 1 receptor subtypes might allow glucocorticoids to exert adjusted effects in their various target tissues.""}"

The basement of the WGC remains mostly in its original state. This article presents the geochronology of the granites, as well as a study of the thermal effects these granites had on the neighbouring Wangtu metasediments. Dating of zircon by the ID-TIMS method in two granite samples yields ages of 1872.1 ± 2.5 Ma and 1861 ± 13 Ma. The granites exhibit similarities to porphyry-type granite, characterised by the presence of feldspar and quartz clasts, which are wrapped around by biotite and mica minerals. Monazite in two metasedimentary rocks of the WGC define U-Th-Pbtotal chemical ages of ~ 1800 Ma but with partly more reset values down to 1400 Ma. Partial discordance of both zircon and monazite reflects the Cenozoic tectonics affecting the region. The results obtained from this study reveal the north Indian continental margin was an active subduction zone during the Paleoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent assembly that extends across the Himalaya.""}"

Patients and Methods A linkage study between the National Joint Registry, Hospital Episodes Statistics and records of the Office for National Statistics on deaths was undertaken. Patients who underwent elective total hip arthroplasty between January 2003 and December 2014 with no past history of cardiac failure were included and stratified as having either a MoM (n = 53 529) or a non-MoM (n = 482 247) arthroplasty. The primary outcome measure was the time to an admission to hospital for cardiac failure or death. Analysis was carried out using data from all patients and from those matched by propensity score. Results The risk of cardiac failure was lower in the MoM cohort compared with the non-MoM cohort (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.901; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.853 to 0.953). The risk of cardiac failure was similar following matching (aHR 0.909; 95% CI 0.838 to 0.987) and the findings were consistent in subgroup analysis. Conclusion The risk of cardiac failure following total hip arthroplasty was not increased in those in whom MoM implants were used, compared with those in whom other types of prostheses were used, in the first seven years after surgery.

However, whether family members of individuals with MASLD also share an increased cardiovascular risk is unknown. METHODS: We created a nationwide multigenerational cohort study identifying all family members of Swedish adults diagnosed with biopsy-proven MASLD (1969−2017) and of matched general population comparators (by age, sex, calendar year, and county of residence). We calculated incidence rates and used Cox models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or cardiovascular death. Cox models were adjusted for education, country of birth, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the Charlson comorbidity index. RESULTS: We identified 22 267 MASLD first-degree relatives (FDRs; parents, siblings, and offspring) and 5687 MASLD spouses, as well as 118 056 comparator FDRs and 29 389 comparator spouses without earlier cardiovascular disease. Overall, the mean age was 41.8 years (SD, 18.0), and 51.5% were females. Over a median of 24.6 years, the incidence rate for MACE was higher in MASLD FDRs than in comparator FDRs (65.0 versus 62.5/10 000 person-years; aHR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01−1.11]). MASLD FDRs had higher rates of acute myocardial infarction (23.0 versus 20.9/10 000 person-years; aHR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01−1.18]) and cardiovascular death (aHR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01−1.18]). Across generations of FDRs, the risk of MACE was uniformly increased with no differences by relationship (ie, parents, siblings, and offspring; P interaction &gt;0.05). MASLD spouses were also at an increased risk of MACE (117.6 versus 103.5/10 000 person-years; aHR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.01−1.18]). CONCLUSIONS: First-degree relatives of individuals with biopsy-proven MASLD are at slightly higher risk of incident MACE, but absolute risks do not support early screening for cardiovascular disease. Shared lifestyle factors may be the main contributors, as spouses of MASLD patients also had higher risks of MACE.""}"

Moreover, and given the novelty of workplace fun and the lack of research in this field in the context of developing countries, the authors explore the relationship between diversity management and organisational inclusion and explore workplace fun as a predictor of organisational inclusion. Design/methodology/approach A total of 360 questionnaires were collected from nurses in three public hospitals in Egypt. The authors applied a t -test to identify how gender may affect perceptions of diversity management. Moreover, the authors employed hierarchical regressions to test gender and diversity management as predictors of organisational inclusion and to test whether workplace fun can predict organisational inclusion, too. Findings The findings indicate that compared to their male colleagues, female nurses respond to diversity management practices more positively. Second, no significant statistical differences in the mean values for female and male nurses were observed regarding their perceptions of organisational inclusiveness. Third, diversity management is positively associated with organisational inclusion for the nurses. Finally, workplace fun mediates the relationship between diversity management perceptions and organisational inclusion. Originality/value This paper contributes by filling a gap in human resources (HR) research in the health-care sector, in which empirical studies on the relationship between gender, workplace fun and organisational inclusion have been limited so far.""}"

Corporate governance should be focused on ensuring that all stakeholders perform their functions in the best possible way and satisfy their needs while maintaining a balance of interests between them.Purpose &amp;ndash; This article is devoted to the consideration of the possibility of using the integrated business analysis developed by its author, based on a balanced scorecard, in the process of studying the strategic aspects of a company's activities.Design/methodology/approach &amp;ndash; The methodological basis of the study was the concept of business analysis as such and the concept of a balanced scorecard by R. Kaplan and D. Norton.Findings &amp;ndash; It is shown that an integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard involves a comparison with the target value, identifying the causes of deviations and predicting the company's strategic rating. It includes a comprehensive analysis of financial performance, customer performance, internal business process performance, and learning and development performance of a company's balanced system. Integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard begins with the analysis of the indicators of training and development of the company's personnel and ends with the forecasting of its strategic rating. His methodological tools are expert- score rating, comparison method, graphical and tabular methods, factor analysis techniques and various forecasting methods. Development of an integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard is the result of further development of the concepts of business analysis and a balanced scorecard and is aimed at further improving the information support of the strategic management of the company, ensuring its sustainable development in the long term.Originality/value &amp;ndash; The author comes to the conclusion that integrated business analysis based on a balanced scorecard is a new and quite effective tool for studying the strategic aspects of a company's activities, forming the analytical support for its strategic management in modern conditions. Its results can be used in the development of management decisions not only long-term, but also medium-term and short-term, providing a sufficient degree of stability of the company from the point of view of its main stakeholders.""}"

Tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) is abundantly present in RA patients’ serum and the arthritic synovium. This review, therefore, discusses first the role and regulation of the major proinflammatory cytokine TNF‐α, in particular the regulation of TNF‐α production, post‐translational processing and signaling of TNF‐α and its receptors.

Angiomotin was recently identified as a new pro‐angiogenic molecule. Angiomotin is expressed as two protein isoforms, p80 and p130. Whereas p80 stimulates endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis, p130 is rather characteristic of stabilized and matured vessels. To date, how angiomotin expression is physiologically regulated in vivo remains largely unknown. We thus investigated (1) whether angiomotin was physiologically expressed in skeletal muscle; (2) whether exercise training, known to stimulate muscle angiogenesis, affected angiomotin expression; and (3) whether such regulation was altered in obesity, a pathological situation often associated with an impaired angiogenic activity and some capillary rarefaction in skeletal muscle. Two models of obesity were used: a high fat diet regime and Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF). Our results provide evidence that angiomotin was expressed both in capillaries and myofibres. In non‐obese rats, the p80 isoform was increased in plantaris muscle in response to endurance training whereas p130 was unaffected. In obese animals, no change was observed for p80 whereas training significantly decreased p130 expression. Exercise training induced angiogenesis in plantaris from both obese and non‐obese rats, possibly through the modulation of angiomotin level and its consequences on RhoA–ROCK signalling. In conclusion, any increase in p80 or decrease in p130, as respectively observed in non‐obese and obese animals, led to an increased ratio between p80 and p130 isoforms. This increased angiomotin p80/p130 ratio might then directly reflect the enhanced angiogenic ability of skeletal muscle in response to exercise training.""}"

As medições foram realizadas na linha de feixe de 10100 keV do Microtron de São Paulo. Os alvos foram confeccionados no Laboratório de Filmes Finos, pela técnica de deposição física de vapor (alvo de Au), e no Laboratório de Materiais Magnéticos, pela técnica de sputtering (alvos de Ta e W), enquanto que a caracterização deles foi realizada no Laboratório de Materiais e Feixes Iônicos, pela técnica de espectrometria de retroespalhamento Rutherford. O Microtron de São Paulo, bem como os laboratórios onde os alvos foram confeccionados e caracterizados, estão no Instituto de Física da Universidade de São Paulo. Os raios x decorrentes da ionização dos alvos foram detetados simultaneamente por três Silicon Drift Detectors localizados a 31°, 90° e 125° com relação à direção do feixe incidente. A determinação da eficiência de pico dos detetores foi realizada com um modelo analítico testado separadamente. As intensidades das linhas do multipleto de raios x L foram ajustadas em um único procedimento empregando funções Voigt para descrevê-las. O parâmetro de alinhamento A20 foi estimado a partir do conjunto de intensidades das linhas Ll, L1 e L2. A fim de comparar os resultados experimentais com as previsões teóricas foi calculado o parâmetro de alinhamento com a aproximação de Born de ondas planas não relativística, empregando as aproximações de HartreeSlater e DiracHartreeSlater para descrever os potenciais atômicos. Os resultados experimentais confirmaram a emissão não isotrópica dos raios x decorrentes de vacâncias preenchidas na subcamada L3, sendo que a magnitude desta anisotropia varia com a energia do feixe de elétrons incidente. Além disso, foram observadas anisotropias de sinais opostos para as linhas L1 e L2. A dependência em energia do parâmetro de alinhamento A20 mostra uma queda rápida de A20, com duas inversões de sinal, uma em torno de 2 E/E(L3) e outra em torno de 8 E/E(L3), e um valor não nulo de alinhamento em torno de 10 E/E(L3), para os três elementos estudados. A comparação dos resultados experimentais com os cálculos realizados mostra um bom acordo ate cerca de 5 E/E(L3) para o feixe de elétrons incidente, a partir deste ponto o experimento evidencia uma segunda inversão no sinal de A20, que não é prevista por essa teoria.

The telecommunications regulator, OFTEL, decided that BT should unbundle its local loops and allow competing operators access to its ubiquitous copper-based local access network to facilitate the provision of higher bandwidth services to the mass market. The spectrum regulator, the Radio communications Agency (RA), an executive agency of the DTI, announced that spectrum would be made available for operators to deliver broadband services throughout the country using local microwave networks. It also published an Information Memorandum for the running of an auction for third-generation mobile networks, which will permit the delivery of higher bandwidth services to mobile terminals. Each of these technologies involves local access networks which are or will be capable of delivering not only high speed Internet access but also the traditional broadcast services to everyone.""}"

The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypotheses that (1) reduced levels of spontaneous physical activity in old rats are associated with skeletal muscle vascular remodelling (e.g. arterial rarefaction), and (2) consequent to a vascular remodelling, calculated shear stress is maintained in feed arteries of aged muscle at levels commensurate with that in young. Activity during daily light and dark cycles (12–12 h) was measured at 30‐s intervals for 2 weeks in young (6 months; n = 9) and old (24 months; n = 9) Fisher 344 rats via telemetry. Subsequently, the gastrocnemius complex and soleus muscles were excised and all feed arteries were counted, isolated, cannulated and maximally dilated for measurement of luminal diameter. Resting blood flow was also measured to estimate vessel wall shear‐stress in the feed arteries perforating the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. Overall, young rats were ∼1.6 times more active during dark periods and ∼4 times more active during light periods than old rats. In addition, young rats had approximately one additional feed artery perforating both the soleus (young, 3.3 ± 0.2; old, 2.6 ± 0.2 vessels; P &lt; 0.05) and gastrocnemius (young, 8.8 ± 0.1; old, 7.5 ± 0.2 vessels, P &lt; 0.05) muscles compared with old rats. However, average vessel wall shear stress at rest was similar between young and old rats (soleus: Y, 65 ± 5; O, 64 ± 5 dynes cm −2 ; gastrocnemius: Y, 329 ± 22; O, 327 ± 27 dynes cm −2 ) resulting from a larger vessel diameter in arteries from old rats. In conclusion, lower activity levels of old rats likely contribute to resistance artery rarefaction and, consequently, this provides a plausible mechanism for the altered blood flow patterns observed during exercise in aged skeletal muscle.""}"

The earliest immigrants to America, white Europeans, understood indigenous peoples as “new” and Other, rather than themselves, and interpreted Native deaths by disease as God’s clearing the land for colonization. Once established, later generations of white Anglo nativists maligned subsequent immigrant groups they rejected as especially prone to sickness and God’s judgment. These beliefs were informed and supplied by the metaphors and theology of the Book of Revelation, which depicts those outside the walls of the New Jerusalem as “filthy” and immoral, to be barred from entry. The chapter analyzes apocalyptic conceptions of disease from the colonial period through the nineteenth century, when nativists associated outbreaks of yellow fever and cholera with sinful and filthy immigrants and as God’s disciplining and warning his chosen nation. The discussion then moves to the turn of the century, as nativists further associated cleanliness with godliness and Americanness, so that immigrant belonging and assimilability, particularly of Irish, Italian, Greek, Russian, and Jewish people, depended in large part on their perceived health and hygiene.""}"

The approach proved highly feasible when the isolation of RGAs is the main objective, since 18% of all obtained ESTs showed significant hits with known RGAs, when translated into their corresponding amino acid sequences and searched against the nonredundant GenBank protein database using the BLASTX algorithm.""}"

We performed the TAXUS III trial to evaluate the feasibility and safety of paclitaxel-eluting stent for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR). Methods and Results— The TAXUS III trial was a single-arm, 2-center study that enrolled 28 patients with ISR meeting the criteria of lesion length ≤30 mm, 50% to 99% diameter stenosis, and vessel diameter 3.0 to 3.5 mm. They were treated with one or more TAXUS NIRx paclitaxel-eluting stents. Twenty-five patients completed the angiographic follow-up at 6 months, and 17 of these underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination. No subacute stent thrombosis occurred up to 12 months, but there was one late chronic total occlusion, and additional 3 patients showed angiographic restenosis. The mean late loss was 0.54 mm, with neointimal hyperplasia volume of 20.3 mm 3 . The major adverse cardiac event rate was 29% (8 patients; 1 non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, 1 coronary artery bypass grafting, and 6 target lesion revascularization [TLR]). Of the patients with TLR, 1 had restenosis in a bare stent implanted for edge dissection and 2 had restenosis in a gap between 2 paclitaxel-eluting stents. Two patients without angiographic restenosis underwent TLR as a result of the IVUS assessment at follow-up (1 incomplete apposition and 1 insufficient expansion of the stent). Conclusions— Paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation is considered safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of ISR. IVUS guidance to ensure good stent deployment with complete coverage of target lesion may reduce reintervention.""}"

Despite lengthy and costly case-by-case approval processes, often too many credits are awarded per project (over-crediting), and many projects would have happened anyway (non-additionality). Here we investigate a novel additionality regime based on: (i) dynamic positive lists that define automatic eligibility criteria, specified by host country and by project type; and (ii) partial credit issuance to reflect context-specific non-additionality risks. We carry out simulation analysis, conducted on a synthetic project pool calibrated on historical data, to demonstrate that this approach performs better than current practice under most scenarios in terms of emissions reductions, cost efficiency, and resilience against systematic over-crediting. The findings support a standardised assessment approach over project-specific evaluation, and they call for more disaggregated analysis across heterogeneous contexts to mitigate regulatory biases and deliver a simpler certification process with better climate outcomes.""}"

Thus, contemporary surgery aims to reduce complications by applying collagen or hyaluronic acid in the socket after extracting the impacted mandibular third molars.This study aimed to study the efficacy of Hyaluronic Acid (HA) addition to collagen, compared to collagen application alone, on the magnitude of swelling and trismus following impacted mandibular third molar surgery. Methods: About 20 patients underwent impacted bilateral lower third molars surgery (n = 40). Opaque envelopes carried out randomization; two materials were applied topically in the socket collagen alone or with hyaluronic. The post-operative mouth-opening limitation and swelling rate were assessed on the third and seventh days after the extraction. Results: The mean age was 22.7 ± 3.079 years (75% female, 25% male). A statistically significant difference was detected for the trismus between the two treatment groups on the seventh (p= 0.005) but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant on the third day (p= 0.061). The swelling scores of the hyaluronic acid addition group were significantly lesser than those of the collagen alone group on the third and the seventh days (p&lt;0.05) except for lateral canthus to angulus mandibulae on the third day (p= 0.133). Conclusion: Adding hyaluronic acid to collagen could effectively reduce the severity of facial swelling and trismus following surgical extraction of impacted lower third molars.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of such retinal vascular pathology were not previously explored. Here, by modifying a method of enzymatically clearing non-vascular retinal tissue and fluorescent immunolabeling of the isolated blood vessel network, we identified substantial pericyte loss together with significant Aβ deposition in retinal microvasculature and pericytes in AD. Evaluation of postmortem retinas from a cohort of 56 human donors revealed an early and progressive decrease in vascular PDGFRβ in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD compared to cognitively normal controls. Retinal PDGFRβ loss significantly associated with increased retinal vascular Aβ<sub>40</sub> and Aβ<sub>42</sub> burden. Decreased vascular LRP-1 and early apoptosis of pericytes in AD retina were also detected. Mapping of PDGFRβ and Aβ<sub>40</sub> levels in pre-defined retinal subregions indicated that certain geometrical and cellular layers are more susceptible to AD pathology. Further, correlations were identified between retinal vascular abnormalities and cerebral Aβ burden, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and clinical status. Overall, the identification of pericyte and PDGFRβ loss accompanying increased vascular amyloidosis in Alzheimer's retina implies compromised blood-retinal barrier integrity and provides new targets for AD diagnosis and therapy.""}"

The central four-vertex function $Q$ generated by these averages is topologically analyzed in standard fashion in terms of an irreducible four-vertex quantity $e$.

They attempted to define the Greek term πίστις in Paul’s usage from multiple angles. One of the recent attempts was done by a classicist Teresa Morgan. Morgan argued that Paul and NT writers based their use of the term πίστις upon its common social understanding of trust in relationship in 1CE. Responding to and independently from her, Pauline scholars produced books and articles to tackle Paul’s understanding of πίστις. Joining this scholarly conversation regarding πίστις, we therefore would like to explore in this paper Paul’s understanding of it with particular attention to its threefold meanings, rejecting the simplistic tendency to define the term uniformly throughout the whole body of his letters. First, the term πίστις means the believers’ positive acceptance of the salvation message in Jesus’ Gospel on the basis of their cognitive change of its evaluation. In this sense, πίστις means faith in the truth claim of Jesus’ Gospel, and reveals the believers’ personal confidence in God’s salvation accomplished by Jesus. Second, πίστις however means total trust in God, who initiated the salvation and accomplished it through his Son Jesus, and Jesus on the basis of their personal belief in the veracity of Jesus event. God proved his faithfulness toward his people by sending his Son to the world and sacrificing him. Through Jesus event transmitted by Paul’s Gospel, that is, through Jesus’ death and resurrection, the believers came to trust in the faithfulness of their God and their savior Jesus. And on the basis of their trust, they are able to enter into a new covenantal relationship with God. Finally, the believers’ change of mind toward and positive acceptance of God’s Gospel, and their trust in God and Jesus require them to show persistent obedience toward God. The πίστις in terms of continuous obedience becomes a new existential realm for the believers and a new life principle. The πίστις in this sense should continue to grow through various life temptations and trials, and should govern their life as the life principle. In this way, the term πίστις for Paul is a very dynamic one with multiple implications in it. This means that when we interpret Paul, we should not reduce the term πίστις to just one meaning and thereby, limit the dynamics of Pauline theology. Our understanding of Paul will be made proper when we pay attention to particular implications of this term in various contexts of Paul’s letters.""}"

Adolescents with low literacy make harmful decisions, take risks, and have worse health and self-management. These factors contribute to the magnitude and severity of problems related sexuality and reproduction, including unintended pregnancy, HIV/STIs, unsafe abortion, and death. On the other hand, information regarding level of literacy in reproductive and sexual health is scarce. Methods Cross-sectional study design among late adolescent students was carried out in Arba Minch and Sawla town high schools from May 20–June 20, 2023. Multistage sampling technique was employed to recruit 577 students. EpiData-3.1 used to enter data and analyzed using SPSS-25. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to identify associated factors with limited reproductive and sexual health literacy. Variables with a p-value &lt; 0.25 in bivariable logistic regression were candidates for multivariable logistic regression. A Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic was checked and was satisfied. Statistical significance was indicated at p-value &lt; 0.05. Result The proportion of limitation in reproductive and sexual health literacy was 69.6% (CI 65.3%, 72.8%) [35.6% problematic and 34.0% inadequate]. Limited literacy was significantly associated with school type [public school AOR 0.28 (0.17–0.46)], mother’s occupation [merchant AOR 0.42 (0.23–0.76)], family monthly income [income 10,000–20,000 birr AOR 0.45 (0.22–0.95)], having regular physical exercise &gt; 30 min [more than once per week, AOR 0.44 (0.23–0.84)], and knowledge about condoms [poor knowledge related to condoms AOR 2.23 (1.38–3.64)]. Conclusion A notable segment of adolescent exhibited inadequate reproductive and sexual health literacy.

This chapter asks how successfully these productions addressed the problem of making the sexual politics of an ancient play relevant today.""}"

Historical descriptions (of the classical past; medieval dress; customs of the Tudors, and such like) became placeholders for ‘news’ in these popular papers. Using John Clare’s The Shepherd’s Calendar (1827) as an important commentary on the intersections of print and different forms of time in the 1820s, this chapter measures the time lag of the news for most Londoners who were unable to afford expensive newspapers and instead relied on out-of-date information, or topical popular publications, and so were struggling to catch up and, in the meanwhile, were encountering history as news.""}"

The concentrations of these drug classes were analyzed in PM<sub>2.5 </sub>from an urban area in Beijing during the autumn and winter of 2017&ndash;2018. There were four heavy haze episodes during the campaign; two of which happened prior to heating whereas the other two after heating. During the entire course of sampling, the mean total concentrations of the nine NACs and the eight OPAHs were 1.2&ndash;263 and 2.1&ndash;234 ng m<sup>-3</sup>, respectively. The concentrations of both NACs and OPAHs were approximately 2&ndash;3 times higher in the heating period than before heating. For NACs, the relative molecular composition did not change significantly before and during heating, with 4-nitrocatechol and 4-nitrophenol demonstrating the highest abundance. For OPAHs, 1-Naphthaldehyde was the most abundant species before and during heating, while the relative proportion of Anthraquinone increased by more than twice, from 13 % before heating to 31 % during the heating. In Beijing's urban area during autumn and winter, significant sources of NACs and OPAHs have been traced back to automobile emissions and biomass-burning activities. Interestingly, it was observed that the contribution from coal combustion increased notably with the onset of heating during this period. It is worth noticing that the secondary generation of BrC was important throughout the whole sampling period, which was manifested by the photochemical reaction before heating and the aqueous reaction during heating. It was further found that the haze in autumn and winter was nitrate-driven before heating and SOC-driven when heating began, and the secondary formation of BrC increased significantly in pollution events, particularly during heating.""}"

In contrast, the similar mouse protein Cyp2d-9 was first characterized as a testosterone 16α-hydroxylase. No common substrates have been reported for the two enzymes. Here we investigate the structural basis of this difference in substrate specificity. We have earlier used a combination of NMR data and homology modelling to generate a three-dimensional model of CYP2D6 [Modi, Paine, Sutcliffe, Lian, Primrose, Wolf, C. R. and Roberts (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4541–4550]. We have now generated a homology model of Cyp2d-9 and compared the two models to identify specific amino acid residues that we believe form the substrate-binding site in each protein and therefore influence catalytic selectivity. Although there are many similarities in active site structure, the most notable difference is a phenylalanine residue (Phe-483) in CYP2D6, which in the model is located such that the bulky phenyl ring is positioned across the channel mouth, thus limiting the size of substrate that can access the active site. In Cyp2d-9, the corresponding position is occupied by an isoleucine residue, which imposes fewer steric restraints on the size of substrate that can access the active site. To investigate whether the amino acid residue at this position does indeed influence the catalytic selectivity of these enzymes, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change Phe-483 in CYP2D6 to isoleucine and also to tryptophan. CYP2D6, Cyp2d-9 and both mutant CYP2D6 proteins were co-expressed with NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase as a functional mono-oxygenase system in Escherichia coliand their relative catalytic activities towards bufuralol and testosterone were determined. All four proteins exhibited catalytic activity towards bufuralol but only Cyp2d-9 catalysed the formation of 16α-hydroxytesterone. Uniquely, the CYP2D6F483I mutant acquired the ability to metabolize testosterone to a novel product, which was identified by MS and proton NMR spectroscopy as 15α-hydroxytestosterone. NMR spin relaxation experiments were used to measure distances between the haem iron and protons of testosterone bound to the CYP2D6F483I mutant. These experiments demonstrate that very minor modifications to the active site structure of CYP2D6 can have a profound influence on the substrate specificity of the enzyme.""}"

Among different loci, the composition of the extracellular microenvironment, including pH, may differ substantially. For example, it has been reported that BK channels are expressed in lysosomes with their extracellular side facing the strongly acidified lysosomal lumen (pH ~4.5). Here we show that BK activation is strongly and reversibly inhibited by extracellular H+, with its conductance-voltage relationship shifted by more than +100 mV at pHO 4. Our results reveal that this inhibition is mainly caused by H+ inhibition of BK voltage-sensor (VSD) activation through three acidic residues on the extracellular side of BK VSD. Given that these key residues (D133, D147, D153) are highly conserved among members in the voltage-dependent cation channel superfamily, the mechanism underlying BK inhibition by extracellular acidification might also be applicable to other members in the family. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38060.001 Introduction A hallmark of BK-type Ca2+ and voltage-activated K+ channels is its dual regulation by two distinct physiological signals, Ca2+ and membrane potential (Latorre et al., 1982; DiChiara and Reinhart, 1995; Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002). The key Ca2+ and voltage-sensing functions of the BK channel are embedded within the pore-forming BK α subunit and arise from interactions among three linked modules: a central pore-gate domain (PGD) that forms a K+-selective ion permeation pathway, a transmembrane voltage-sensor domain (VSD) similar to that of the voltage-gate K+ (Kv) channels (Ma et al., 2006), and two regulator of conductance for K+ (RCK) domains that form a cytosolic gating ring (CTD) to provide binding sites for intracellular ligands such as Ca2+ (Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997; Jiang et al., 2001; Shi et al., 2002; Xia et al., 2002, 2004). Yet, despite the common Ca2+- and voltage-sensing functions of all BK channels, BK channels typically exhibit considerable diversity in their functional properties among different loci of expression, for example, in epithelial cells (Bailey et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2007), smooth muscle (Robitaille et al., 1993; Wellman and Nelson, 2003; Tanaka et al., 2004), neurons (Reinhart et al., 1991; Rosenblatt et al., 1997; Meredith et al., 2006), potentially even in various organelles (Singh et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), thereby allowing them to play physiological roles suited to their particular location of expression. This diversity in function occurs despite the fact that only a single gene (KCa1.1; Kcnma1) encodes the pore-forming subunit of all BK channels. As a consequence, a critical part of understanding potential physiological roles of BK channels has been in uncovering the various factors and mechanisms that define cell-specific functional properties. What factors contribute to defining the physiological roles of BK channels? At least some diversity in BK channel properties can arise from the stable cell-specific molecular composition of the BK channel complex, including alternative splicing of pore-forming α subunits (Tseng-Crank et al., 1994; Rosenblatt et al., 1997) and co-assembly with various accessory subunits (Wallner et al., 1996; Xia et al., 1999; Brenner et al., 2000; Xia et al., 2000; Brenner et al., 2005; Yan and Aldrich, 2010). BK channels can also be regulated on a shorter time scale by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation (Tian et al., 2004, 2008) or even more briefly by binding of soluble factors to the BK channel complex, such as Ca2+ (Magleby and Pallotta, 1983; Schreiber and Salkoff, 1997; Xia et al., 2002), Mg2+(Shi and Cui, 2001; Zhang et al., 2001b; Shi et al., 2002; Horrigan and Ma, 2008), heme (Tang et al., 2003; Horrigan et al., 2005), carbon monoxide (Hou et al., 2008b), or omega-3 fatty acid (Hoshi et al., 2013b, 2013a). In the latter cases, modulation of BK activity appears to involve interactions with the regulatory factors to binding sites on the intracellular side of the BK channel. In contrast, despite the fact that the extracellular side of BK channels may be exposed to a wide range of microenvironments, little is known about how and even whether regulation of BK channels by extracellular soluble factors may occur. One common potential extracellular regulator might be protons (H+). Many BK channels are expressed in loci where they may experience extremely low extracellular pH (pHO <5). For example, BK channels regulate potassium secretion in the distal nephron (Bailey et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2007), while urinary pH ranges from 6.5 to 7.5 daily in healthy people and may vary from 4.5 to 8.0 in pathological conditions (Wagner et al., 2004). Recently, BK channels were proposed to regulate Ca2+ release/refilling and membrane trafficking of lysosomes (Cao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017). In the case of lysosomes, the BK channels are oriented with their extracellular side exposed to a high concentration of H+ in the lumen of the lysosome, the pH of which ranges from 4.2 to 4.7 (Mindell, 2012; Xu and Ren, 2015). Some previous work on Kv1 (Claydon et al., 2000; Kwan et al., 2006; Claydon et al., 2007, Claydon et al., 2008) and KCNQ channels (Prole et al., 2003) establishes precedence that some Kv channels may be sensitive to pHO in the pH range of 5–7, perhaps by effects on the pore region of these channels (Zhang et al., 2003; Claydon et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2017). However, the impact of pHO below pH five such as that which might be found in the lumen of a lysosome has not been systematically examined in Kv channels. In this study, we address the questions of whether BK channels are sensitive to changes in pHO and what the underlying mechanism of pHO regulation might be. We report a strong and reversible inhibition of BK channel function by extracellular H+ beginning around pHO 6. The primary effect of low pHO on BK channel function is to inhibit the activation of the BK VSD. In addition, a moderate change in the closed-open equilibrium of the BK permeation gate in favor of closed states also contributes to inhibition induced by extracellular acidification. The combination of these two effects positively shifts the BK conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship by more than 100 mV at pHO 4. We further show that three acidic residues on the extracellular side of the BK VSD are involved in such inhibition. As stated above, BK channels are widely expressed on plasma membranes of a diverse variety of cells, some of which may be exposed to unusual and varying extracellular milieu, for example, in the kidney (Bailey et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2007) or intestinal crypts (Sandle et al., 2007; Sørensen et al., 2011). Furthermore, BK channels have been reported to be in the membranes of intracellular organelles (Cao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017), in which the normally extracellular side of the BK channel will face the organelle lumen, often a highly acidic compartment. Given such factors, the present results impact on the proper assessment of the potential physiological and pathological roles that BK channels may play in such loci. Furthermore, given that the three key residues identified in this study are highly conserved among members in the voltage-dependent cation channel superfamily, the mechanism underlying BK inhibition by strong extracellular acidification might also be applicable to Kv channels and other members in this family, some of which also perform their physiological function in extremely acidic environments (Heitzmann and Warth, 2007). Results BK channel activation is strongly inhibited at pHO lower than 5 Given the possibility that BK channels may be expressed in loci in which the normally extracellular side of BK channels is exposed to acidic conditions, here we have examined the impact of pHO on BK channel function. Figure 1A shows macroscopic BK currents recorded from an outside-out patch perfusing in extracellular solutions at pH 7 (left), pH 4 (middle), and back to pH 7 (right). The amplitude of macroscopic BK current was reduced at pHO 4, with reduction became increasingly apparent as the voltage is made more negative, for example, comparing moderate depolarization at +60 mV (Figure 1A, red traces) to that at +160 mV (Figure 1C, blue trace), or comparing the reduction in inward tails at −120 mV (Figure 1A and B) to the reduction in outward current at +160 mV (Figure 1C, blue trace). A previous study showed that neutralization of a highly conserved acidic residue (D292N) in the BK channel pore region reduces single channel conductance and induces an outward rectification in resulting BK channels (Haug et al., 2004b). In a similar fashion, we observed that BK single channel conductance was reduced by ~50% at −120 mV and ~20% at +60 mV when pHO was changed from 7 to 4 (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). This change in single channel conductance can largely account for the reduction of maximum tail current at −120 mV (Figure 1B). However, it is also clear that the reduction of BK single channel conductance induced by extracellular acidification accounts for only a small portion of the changes in outward current amplitude over the physiologically relevant voltage range (e.g. the amplitude of macroscopic BK current at +60 mV was reduced by ~85% when pHO was changed from 7 to 4). At more positive potentials, the amplitude of BK current at pHO 4 was closer to that at pHO 7. However, the reduction in macroscopic current amplitude with pHO changed from 7 to 4 was greater than that in single channel conductance over all the voltages we examined. For example, the amplitude of current evoked by +160 mV pulse at pHO 4 was only 0.72 ± 0.02 (n = 9) of that at pHO 7, while the BK single channel conductance at pHO 4 was estimated to be 0.88 of that at pHO 7 at the same voltage (Figure 1C). Above results indicate that extracellular acidification strongly shifts the voltage-dependent gating of BK channel toward positive potential. Figure 1 with 1 supplement see all Download asset Open asset BK channel activation is strongly inhibited when pHO is lower than 5. (A) Macroscopic BK currents recorded from an outside-out patch perfused with extracellular solutions at pH 7 (left), pH 4 (middle), and back to pH 7. Currents were evoked by steps from −160 to +160 mV at pHO 7 and by steps from −160 mV to +200 mV at pHO 4 (20 mV increments). The pre- and post-test pulse voltages were −140 and −120 mV, respectively. 300 μM Ca2+ was included in pipette (intracellular) solution. The red traces were evoked by +60 mV pulses to highlight the much larger fractional reduction in outward current at this voltage compared to that at +160 mV (blue traces). (B) G-V curves of BK channel generated from tail currents recorded at various pHOs with values normalized to the maximum value at pHO 7. Physiologically relevant voltage range (±60 mV) is marked by two vertical dotted lines here and in panel D. Boltzmann fit results (solid lines) are Gmax = 1.06 ± 0.01, z = 0.97 ± 0.03 e, Vh = −48.8 ± 1.0 mV (pH 9), Gmax = 0.95 ± 0.01, z = 1.00 ± 0.04 e, Vh = −32.4 ± 1.2 mV (pH 7), Gmax = 0.80 ± 0.01, z = 0.97 ± 0.06 e, Vh = −11.7 ± 1.8 mV (pH 6), Gmax = 0.66 ± 0.01, z = 0.86 ± 0.05 e, Vh =+34.8 ± 2.3 mV (pH 5), Gmax = 0.46 ± 0.02, z = 0.90 ± 0.09 e, Vh =+107 ± 3.7 mV (pH 4). The number in parentheses is the number of experiments contributing to each G-V relationship. (C) Voltage-dependent change of BK single channel current induced by extracellular acidification. The filled dots are fractional BK single channel current amplitude determined over the voltage range of ±100 mV when pHO changed from 7 to 4. The Woodhull model (refer to Materials and methods) fit results (solid line) are: kd0 = 0.27 ± 0.02 mM (pH 3.6) and δ = 0.17 e ± 0.02. The prediction of fractional BK single channel current amplitude by the Woodhull model is extended to ±200 mV. Note that the residual single channel current at −120 mV at pHO 4.0 is predicted to be 0.55 of that at pHO 7.0, which is comparable to the Gmax at pHO 4 in panel B. (D) BK G-V curves as those shown in panel B, but with the values at each pHO normalized to the maximum value within that pHO. Boltzmann fit results (solid lines) are Gmax = 0.97 ± 0.01, z = 0.98 ± 0.04 e, Vh = −48.3 ± 1.1 mV (pH 9), Gmax = 0.98 ± 0.01, z = 1.05 ± 0.04 e, Vh = −30.5 ± 1.1 mV (pH 7), Gmax = 0.96 ± 0.01, z = 1.04 ± 0.05 e, Vh = −14.5 ± 1.2 mV (pH 6), Gmax = 0.97 ± 0.01, z = 0.86 ± 0.04 e, Vh =+35.0 ± 1.6 mV (pH 5), Gmax = 1.01 ± 0.02, z = 0.90 ± 0.04 e, Vh =+107.6 ± 1.8 mV (pH 4). The Vh and z values are virtually identical to those determined from the G-Vs in Figure 1B. (E) Dose-response curve of BK gating shift (ΔVh) induced by extracellular H+. Hill equation (ΔVh=ΔVmax/(1+(IC50/[H+])n)) fit result (solid line) is: IC50 = 0.17 ± 0.28 mM (pH 3.8), n = 0.41 ± 0.07. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.38060.002 We therefore plotted the conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship for BK activation at a given pHO normalized to the maximum conductance at that pHO (Figure 1D). This revealed that the G-V relationship was shifted toward positive potentials with increases in extracellular [H+]. The BK half-activation potential (Vh) was shifted by more than +60 mV when pHO was changed from 7 to 5 and was further shifted by another +70 mV at pHO 4. With a gating shift of this magnitude, the PO of BK did not reach maximum level even at +160 mV when pHO was changed from 7 to 4 (Figure 1D). In addition to reduction in current amplitude, the kinetics of BK current was also significantly changed with elevation of extracellular [H+], with activation being much slower while deactivation being much faster at pHO 4 than at pHO 7 (Figure 1A). These changes in channel kinetics are also consistent with the gating of BK channels shifted toward positive potentials by extracellular H+. Importantly, the activation of BK channels remained low over the physiologically relevant voltage range of ±60 mV at pHO 4 even with saturating [Ca2+]in (Figure 1D). Therefore, the primary contributor to reduction in BK activation at pHO 4.0 over these voltages is the shifted BK gating but not the reduction in single channel conductance. The gating shift induced by extracellular H+ appeared to be independent of [Ca2+]in as a comparable G-V shift was observed with 10 μM [Ca2+]in (Figure 3C). It should be noted that even with a rather modest gating shift such as that induced by pHO of 6 (~20 mV), the resulting reduction in the BK channel current could still be sufficient to markedly alter the physiological function of BK channels. The change of Vh induced by extracellular acidification is plotted against pHO in Figure 1E. The approximate IC50 of pHO-dependent BK G-V shift is pH 3.8, suggesting that acidic residue(s) on the extracellular side of the BK channel may be involved in this inhibition. A change in the C-O equilibrium only accounts for a small portion of the gating shift induced by extracellular H+ We next sought to address the question of the mechanistic basis for the rightward gating shift induced by extracellular protons. Extracellular H+ might inhibit BK channel activation by several different mechanisms, including inhibition of either opening of the BK permeation gate or activation of the BK VSD. The modular design of BK channel protein and allosteric nature of BK channel gating make it possible to examine these possibilities separately. Previous studies suggest that extracellular acidification inhibits Kv1 channels by enhancing inactivation in the pore domain of these channels (Claydon et al., 2007; Kwan et al., 2006; Trapani and Korn, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). Therefore, we started by examining the effects of extracellular acidification on the closed-open equilibrium in the BK pore region. To do this, we recorded BK single channel currents at negative potentials (−100, −120, −140 mV) where BK VSDs are largely in resting states even with elevated concentrations of [Ca2+]in up to 100 μM (Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002; Carrasquel-Ursulaez et al., 2015). A change in limiting open probability times the number of BK channels (limiting nPO) determined from such recordings reflects a change in the C-O equilibrium of the BK pore gate (Horrigan et al., 1999b). As shown in Figure 2A and B, the limiting nPO of BK channels was moderately reduced when pHO was changed from 7 to 4. The average limiting nPO of BK channels at pHO 4 was between 0.3 and 0.4 of that at pHOseven among the voltages we tested, indicating that the C-O equilibrium constant L of BK channels at pHO 4 was about 1/3 of that at pHO 7. To evaluate the impact of such reduction of L on BK channel gating we simulated G-V relationships using the Horrigan-Aldrich (H-A) model with the zero voltage C-O equilibrium constant (L0) scaled down from one published value of 1 × 10−6 (Horrigan and Aldrich, 2002). As shown in Figures 2C and D, G–V curves simulated with L0 scaled to 1/3 of the control value are only predicted to be positively shifted by about 20 mV from the control G-V, much less than the gating shift observed in our experiments. The H-A simulation also showed that a 1000-fold reduction in L0 was required to reproduce the observed G-V shift if the only effect of extracellular H+ was to alter the C-O equilibrium of BK channel (Figure 2C,D). Therefore, a change in the C-O equilibrium cannot fully account for the gating shift induced by extracellular acidification.

DCs were generated by culturing blood monocytes in the presence of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 for 5 days. The DC vaccine was prepared by pulsing DCs with cytoplasmic transduction peptide-attached α-fetoprotein, glypican-3 and MAGE-1 recombinant fusion proteins and cultivating them in the presence of maturation cocktail. DCs were injected subcutaneously near the inguinal lymph nodes, followed by topical application of toll-like receptor-7 agonist around the injection site. We showed that our DC vaccine was safe and well-tolerated over 6 vaccinations in 5 patients. All 5 patients showed T cell responses against TAAs. Clinical benefit was observed in one of the 5 patients. In conclusion, the feasibility, safety and immune activity of DCs pulsed with TAAs were confirmed in HCC patients. However, clinical response was detected only in one patient. Future trials may consider applying this therapy in a less advanced stage to obtain better clinical responses.""}"

During 32-day hospitalization, she was treated with Korean medicine, namely, herbal medicine (modified Gamiguibi-tang), acupuncture (15 minutes twice a day at CV23, HT7, LI4, LR3, ST36, SP6, GB20, TE17, PC6, GV20, Ex-HN1, GV24 etc.), moxibustion, and cupping, combined with Western medicine (prednisolone, azathioprine) and physical therapy. Post-treatment, the patient global assessment (PGA) score of dysarthria fell from 100 to 60; grasp power rose from 15 kg to 19 kg and 13 kg to 17 kg in the right and left hands, respectively; and the 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L), EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS), and Beck depression inventory (BDI-II) scores changed from 10 to 8, 0 to 80, and 34 to 7 respectively. Follow-up visits continued for about a month after discharge, improvement in symptoms maintained, and there were no significant side effects.Conclusions: Given the lack of standard treatment for PCD, Korean medicine can be tried clinically for the treatment of PCD patients with dysarthria and weakness of distal extremity.

Critical and costly management decisions are based on quantification of left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction. Recent advances in echocardiography, such as microsphere contrast echocardiography for left ventricular opacification and perfusion imaging, three‐dimensional transthoracic and trans‐oesophageal imaging, strain and tissue Doppler imaging, all contribute to improving accuracy and reproducibility of these important measurements. Such techniques are now routinely available on standard echocardiography equipment in Australian centres for daily use. Hand‐carried ultrasound devices have been developed, which are portable, are affordable and offer increased availability of echocardiography to the wider community. Clinicians should be actively encouraged to adopt these technologies to improve the diagnostic quality and reproducability of echocardiography for our patients. This article provides an overview of important recent advances in echocardiographic imaging with an emphasis on their role in clinical practice today.""}"

The rabbits were sacrificed for the anatomical evaluation of the treated joints and the following results were obtained. 1.The changes seen in the soft tissues were hemorrhage and contracture. 2.The recovery of the joint capsule injury was rapid, but resulted in marked thickening and adhesion in part to the gluteal muscles making the descending of the head difficult. 3.In the experimental dislocation fibrous tear was seen and the elongated ligament Caput femoralis was disrupted near its insertion to the femoral head in all cases. The end of the ligament was pushed between the acetabulum and femoral head in abnormal position. 4.The depth of the acetabulum gradually decreases from abnormal growth of the consisting bones and increasing growth of connective tissue to apoint the acetabulum forms itself a triangular shape. This makes the acetadulum unfitted to the femoral head, resulting fixation difficulty. 5.There was little change in the articular cartilage of the femoral head, in the latter of which coxa vara deformity was present.Histologically eauly termination of epiphyseal guowth, fibuosis ofthe bone marrow in the captial epiphyses and neck, and the atrophy and disappearance of the trabeculae were seen.

Based on this formalism, we are able to simultaneously account for two important effects that have thus far been mostly treated in isolation: (i) the backreaction of the produced gauge fields on the evolution of the inflaton field and (ii) the Schwinger pair production of charged particles in the strong gauge-field background. This allows us to show that the suppression of the gauge-field production due to the Schwinger effect can prevent the backreaction in scenarios in which it would otherwise be relevant. Moreover, we point out that the induced current, &lt;math display=\""inline\""&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=\""bold-italic\""&gt;J&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mo&gt;=&lt;/mo&gt;&lt;mi&gt;σ&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;mi mathvariant=\""bold-italic\""&gt;E&lt;/mi&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, also dampens the Bunch–Davies vacuum fluctuations deep inside the Hubble horizon.

It is therefore important to understand how and when teachers use computer technology in order to devise implementation strategies to encourage them. This study investigates student teachers' perceptions of computer technology in relation to their intention to use computers. The purpose is to shed light on more effective ways to motivate the use of computer technology in schools. Based on an expanded variation of the Technology Acceptance Model , 84 completed surveys of student teachers were collected at a local university in Sweden. Overall, the results indicated that (1) student teachers' perceived usefulness of computer technology had a direct significant effect on their intention to use it; (2) student teachers' perceived ease of use had only an indirect significant effect on intention to use; however, (3) student teachers' subjective norm, that is the possible influence of external expectations, did not have any direct or indirect significant effects on their intention to use computer technology. Theoretical and practical implications that follow from the results are discussed.""}"

Fostering on the Farm: Child Placement in the Rural Midwest. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2015. Pp. 234. Bibliography. Illustrations. Index. Notes. Cloth: $55.00. Megan Birk offers a richly detailed picture of child welfare in the period from 1870 to the Great Depression. The study's timeframe captures a significant period in the history of child welfare policy, while its geographical boundaries allow the author to examine the ground-level practices that resulted from those policies. Reformers' notions about how best to ensure children's well being when their families could not care for them changed significantly in this era, and Birk convincingly argues for the central place of rural history within that narrative. In the 1870s, an idealized, largely nostalgic, agrarian mythos provided the impetus for local agencies, such as county poor houses and orphan asylums, to make rural indentures the cornerstone of their formal child welfare policies. (The custom of binding out children was much older.) Officials tasked with caring for dependent children believed that a steady routine of performing farm chores outdoors could do wonders for children who lived in institutionalized settings, worked long hours in unhealthful indoor environments, or suffered from parental abuse and neglect. Farm living would instill the virtues of industriousness, thrift, and sobriety, rendering poor and deprived children into productive citizens. By 1920 however, child welfare advocates became disenchanted with rural life as a panacea. The Progressive-Era's penchant for social investigation revealed uncomfortable truths about these popular farm placements, including exploitation, deprivation, and abuse uncovered in investigations by the federal Children's Bureau. What is more, reformers themselves now had heightened expectations for what was required to ensure children's well-being. Their vision had expanded to include the provision of extended formal schooling, access to urban amenities such as indoor plumbing and electricity, opportunities for leisure and recreational activities, and the attainment of job skills suitable to employment in a modern industrial economy—necessities that rural communities were unable to provide. The reformers' disillusionment with farm indentures led to the creation of state-run foster care systems that aimed to place children with middle-class urban and suburban families who could offer such modern advantages. Just as importantly, these families were encouraged to view foster children as potential family members rather than sources of free labor. As Birk observes, the \""placement system did not change simply because middle-class Americans changed their minds about the role of children in society. It Book Reviews 97 also changed because the farm itself was in transition\"" (p. 179). Ironically, stark economic realities meant that farm families now more closely resembled the urban poor and working-class households from which children had been removed in previous decades. The book has a few minor shortcomings. Of concern is the absence of attention to racial, ethnic, and sub-regional variables within Birk's analysis. I was not convinced by her conclusion, which glosses over several decades of children's welfare history in order to offer comments about the foster care system in the present day. These cavils aside, Birk's study provides a compelling angle from which to examine the broader, and more familiar, narrative about America's transformation from a rural republic to an urban industrial nation. It is an informative, interesting, and well-researched book that merits attention from historians in a broad range of fields. Lynne Curry Eastern Illinois University Ray E. Boomhower.

Metadichol , a new nanoemulsion formulation that acts as an inverse agonist of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), was tested for its immunomodulatory effects on VDBP release in differentiated human monocytic cell lines Methods: THP-1 and U937 monocytic cell lines were differentiated with PMA (20 ng/ml) and stimulated with LPS. Various Metadichol concentrations (1 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml) were applied to cells for 48 hours. ELISA measured VDBP levels. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation significantly elevated VDBP release in both cell lines (10.19-fold in THP-1 cells: 117.01 ± 2.27 ng/ml; 12.03-fold in U937 cells: 222.56 ± 3.19 ng/ml vs. controls). Metadichol therapy altered VDBP release in a dose-dependent manner. Metadichol , at 100 ng/ml, significantly increased VDBP release (7.12-fold increase in THP-1: 81.73 ± 2.37 ng/ml; 8.36-fold increase in U937: 154.68 ± 3.19 ng/ml) while reducing LPS-induced inflammation. Metadichol shows dose-dependent immunomodulatory effects on VDBP release in human monocytic cells via VDR inverse agonism, outperforming traditional small molecule immunomodulators in immunological activation. The compound's VDR pathway modulation of VDBP levels without surpassing inflammatory thresholds suggests balanced immune response activation with potential therapeutic uses in immunological deficiency, cancer immunotherapy, and age-related immune decline.""}"

Monrouxe"", ""affiliations"": [], ""is_corresponding"": false}, {""name"": ""Gary Poole"", ""affiliations"": [], ""is_corresponding"": false}], ""abstract"": ""This article is part of the Dialogue series which features transcriptions of e-mail discussions focused on a current issue in the field held by two scholars who have approached the issue from different perspectives (for further details, see the editorial published in Med Educ 2012;46(9):826–7). In this contribution to the series, Lynn Monrouxe (Director of Medical Education Research and the School of Medicine at Cardiff University, Wales) and Gary Poole (Associate Professor in the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia, Canada) discuss their evolving perspectives on identity (i.e., individuals’ conceptions and expressions of their individuality and group affiliations) as it pertains to health professional training. The biggest question I am presently grappling with concerns the concept of identity. What does an identity look like and how can we research it? Of course, across the behavioural and social sciences, the concept of identity and identities has been hotly debated and there is no single idea of what this (or these) are.1 But from a personal perspective, I’m still oscillating between the seductive notion of an individual’s identity being something internal to one’s self that can be a measurable and known entity2 and the thinking that identities are co-constructed through interaction in social settings.3 I guess my biggest issue is my personal desire to measure identity within individuals (e.g. moral identity) and relate that back to personal actions. But at the same time, my own research clearly demonstrates that identities (in the plural) are enacted interactionally and are highly fluid and contextual.4 What do you think? I first became interested in the concept of identity when a nursing student in one of my classes decided to drop out of the programme because, in her words, she could not see herself as a nurse. I believe that, in order to make this important decision, this student needed to have an identity that was, as you so clearly put it, internal to herself. Further, the student compared this internal representation with what she was seeing in her practicum work and found an intolerable mismatch. Thus, I approach the study of identity as being internal, captured within a ‘self-schema’. I also see identity development as a process by which people are making the kinds of comparisons that nursing student made – between that self-schema and the person they are being asked to be, or perhaps could be. Identity development, then, also requires a consideration of ‘possible selves’– the people we could perhaps see ourselves becoming.5 In medical students, I see identity development as a process, at least in part, of trying on these possible selves. This is why I am in favour of self-directed project work for our students because it represents an opportunity to take some control over the trying on of possible selves. All this said, I have no trouble acknowledging that identity can be socially constructed. There is longstanding research to indicate that we become the person others expect us to become.6, 7 Furthermore, the identities we construct of others are necessarily oversimplified constructions of who they really are. I believe that people’s full identities are too complex to be stored intact in our memories, so we work to construct identities for others that are more stable than the real thing. With all this in mind, we return to your provocative question: ‘What does an identity look like and how can we research it?’ At this point, identity for me looks like a file stored in memory. Self-schemas are stored for ourselves and person schemas are stored for others. Your comments made me think about a number of issues, some of which I had not anticipated. Again, the concept of cognitive schemas is familiar to me. This resonates with my earlier thinking as a cognitive psychologist and was my personal way of knowing the world as I entered into the field of medical education a decade ago. I think your narrative of the nursing student is a classic example. With my cognitive psychological hat on, I would agree that she is comparing her personal schema of ‘what a nurse is’ with her self-schema, and seeing a mismatch. The logical conclusion therefore is that she is not, and cannot be, a nurse. I guess this fits with other cognitive theories such as deductive logic, which would state: ‘All nurses are X. I am not X, nor will I be X. Therefore, I am not a nurse, nor will I be a nurse.’ But how much of our own thinking and reasoning about the social world is a construct of our education? As cognitive psychologists, we would think identities are schemas/categories, wouldn’t we? But someone with a different background might see the same thing and think identities are quite different. Certainly, I’ve changed my thinking over time and that’s due to my engagement in medical education and the influences of people around me and the literature I have read. And so I think that the concept of identities as being ‘files stored in memory’ could be too constrictive a concept when we look at how people are categorised and constructed within interactional space.8, 9 And what of these self- and person schemas? How are they formed? How does the identity schema of a nurse come to be? Through ‘prototypes’? ‘Typical features’? ‘Exemplars’?10, 11 The other issue your thoughts raise for me is the age-old matter of interdisciplinary communication, in which we use the same terminology but mean different things. So ‘identity as being socially constructed’ means something entirely different when thinking cognitively than it does when thinking within a social constructivist perspective. From the former perspective, it still comes down to cognitively stored schemata (albeit simplistic constructions) derived from language and interaction (so: what language and interaction does to us). But from the latter perspective it is more about what we do with language and artefacts within interactions. So my last point brings me back to the question of what identity is and how we can research it. From my perspective, identities are plural and enacted and can be understood through a systematic analysis of language. Coming back to your nurse, I would ask how she attended to issues such as accountability within her interactional narrative with you (accountability to her decision to drop out) and how she narrated her alternative identities within that accountability.12 For she was, after all, not merely reporting a subjective mismatch between her inner schema and an external ‘reality’. She was holding herself accountable to you for her actions. Don’t you think? Was the nursing student just reporting a mismatch between her self-schema and the perceived role of nurse? I have always seen her narrative in this way, but your comments invite me to expand on my understanding of what was going on in my conversation with her. How else might she have portrayed her decision to drop out of the programme, considering her accountability to that programme and to her own life? She might have reported a different mismatch, perhaps between her personal resources and the demands of the role. She might have said: ‘I am not smart enough… confident enough… patient enough…’ As it turns out, she did not say these things. Is this because she accessed her self-schema and decided that she could manage the demands of the role but chose not to because ‘it wasn’t her’? Or was it because the admission of inadequacy would have been much more difficult, given the way we construct conversations of this kind? I truly don’t know. The distinction here is important because, as you imply, the cognitive psychologist will study the role of identity in a case such as this very differently from someone who might adopt a perspective like ‘symbolic interactionism’, in which the self we present is wrapped up in a complex web of beliefs and perceptions about social context, unstated meanings and the perceived purpose of discourse. Relatedly, I agree that identity needs to be understood in the plural. I also agree with those who posit that some people maintain one constant identity across most situations (low self-monitors), while others carry multiple selves that they bring out based on situational demands (high self-monitors).13 From this view, we could say that the nursing student could not expand her numerous selves to include a new one as nurse. As for how she came to understand what a nurse is, as a psychologist, I would return to the concept of possible selves described by Markus and Nurius.5 Those who write about the process of socialising someone into a field like nursing would focus on how norms are communicated, as in: ‘This is what it looks like to be a nurse.’ A more anthropological view would suggest we need to understand rituals in the profession to understand identity. Such analysis has identified therapeutic and occupational rituals in that field.14 All this agrees with your point that our thinking about the social world is a construct of our training. Now we’re broadening our discussion to include a greater number of ways in which we can understand identities ranging from the individual, social, interpersonal and societal perspectives. Out of interest, I wonder just how reductionist we can be with respect to understanding and researching identities: it seems that even neuroscientists are proposing that we can understand identities by examining neurones and neurotransmitters.15 So what can we make of this? Essentially we are all looking at the same phenomena, but with different eyes. It reminds me of an important lesson I learned about science as a psychologist: explanations of the same phenomena that are made at different levels can be equally valid. So perhaps these are not mutually exclusive accounts; rather, they are complementary. And through further searching I have discovered an interesting researcher in the USA called Ken Wilber. He appears to have tried to integrate theoretical perspectives at different levels and suggests that reality comprises four domains – interior individual (first person), interior collective (second person), exterior individual (third person) and exterior collective (third person) – each with its own ‘truth-standard’ validity.16 Now, while I’m not suggesting for a moment that Wilber’s model16 maps onto the variety of levels of explanation we have discussed so far, what I am wondering is whether there is a way to represent our variety of different perspectives and their truth-standards. Such a description might take us beyond my original ‘what is identity and how can we research this?’ question, and into a more sophisticated description of identities, truth-standards, ways of knowing, research methodologies and how they build on one another to provide a more detailed picture of the ways in which identities are formed, co-constructed, stored, retrieved and enacted (and more). Perhaps? I am intrigued by the work you reference in your last message, Lynn. In my own career as a psychologist, I started as an unapologetic reductionist, and still am to a point. However, like so many people from this tradition, I eventually started studying phenomena that either could not be ‘reduced’ or that lost something vital in the process. I think, for example, of our work interviewing immigrant women in a large suburban maternity unit.17 The need to consider multiple perspectives is underscored in research on identity because identities are constructed at multiple levels, as you point out with your use of the word ‘co-constructed’. As a case in point, I hold the view that personality is something that is created by those who perceive us much more than it is by our own brains. We then shape our actions to be consistent with these other-constructed personalities. I believe we can substitute the word ‘identity’ for ‘personality’ in this case. A pragmatic conclusion from this is that research on identity must not just ask ‘Who are you?’ or ‘Who do you think you are?’ but also ‘Who do you think he or she is?’ Well... I see what you mean by suggesting identity and personality can be substituted, although I guess when we’re focusing on how we research this I become a little concerned, mainly because personality research is very much the domain of psychologists and from an individual perspective, although we do talk about certain types of personality in the collective form (authoritarian, for example). I also agree that we often ‘shape our actions to be consistent with these other-constructed personalities’, but let’s not forget that we also resist these ‘other-constructed personalities’. And this happens at the psychological, social and cultural levels (and therefore also at the level of neurones). And in addition to our actions being consistent with how others see us, self-verification theory suggests that we prefer others to view us as we view ourselves – so we try to elicit reactions that back up our own theories of self (e.g. Swann18). So, if we hold positive views of ourselves, we seek to reinforce these, and if we hold negative self-views, we try to reinforce that negativity.19 And this occurs through the interactive process of identity negotiation, which contributes to the process of shaping, preserving and displaying our self and our group identities. And now I wonder about the different terms we use and how these can become confused and confusing when we engage in research. Terms such as ‘self’, ‘identity’, ‘identities’ and ‘personality’ all have distinct research ‘histories’ and rarely overlap. So to use them interchangeably can confuse. Each has been researched using different paradigms. And so the confusion continues. Theories such as narrative identity theory20, 21 use personal stories to understand how individuals construct their identity; self-identification theory uses an experimental approach to understand this concept; personal construct psychology22 uses the ‘repertory grid’ technique, and symbolic interactionism uses ‘naturalistic’ data (e.g. talk in workplace, home and interview settings) to understand the co-construction of identities (e.g. Goffman’s dramaturgical theory23). So the complexity of the issue is great: there are different levels of explanation, different words and concepts (signifiers), and different theories with different ways of researching them. What can we say pragmatically about this, Gary? You explain very nicely the point that different language takes us into different research traditions. To clarify a comment from my previous message, I think ‘identity’ can be inserted for ‘personality’ in some of the work on social perception. However, this is not to say that the terms are synonymous. For me, personality is primarily about a collection of attributes, whereas identity is about much more: roles, nationalities, gender, place… the list goes on. It is interesting to think about how self-verification processes jibe with tendencies to confirm others’ views of us. One important consideration in determining what motive will prevail – confirming self-identity or confirming others’ perceptions of us – refers to the deliberate decisions we make about with whom we interact. To the extent that we can control that, we will look for people who will be sufficiently similar to us to make for viable comparators when we need to use social comparison to test our views of the world, with a bias towards those who confirm rather than disconfirm our views. We will seek those who confirm our sense of self as well. I am also now wondering about the self-serving value of seeking out those who confirm our negative views of self. For medical students, this must be a tricky business. My first guess is that this strategy might be used to protect against being put in situations for which the student does not feel adequately prepared. A supervisor who agrees with a student’s negative assessment of self might not push the student into the situation. Admittedly, this is a speculative example on my part. I really don’t know if this is what happens, though I believe that such events can work to help shape the student’s identity as a practitioner. Again, thank you for such a thought-provoking response. Your comments about seeking out those who confirm our negative self-views reminded me of a paper I’ve just read by Helmich et al.24 Through their analysis of students’ narratives of early clinical attachments, they found an interplay between emotions (negative and positive), meaning and identity and identified four different ‘paradigms’ of students’ experiences: feeling insecure; complying; developing, and participating (which are similar to Marcia’s identity status paradigms2). It is the ‘feeling insecure’ state in which students find it difficult to find their place (or role), and how the ways in which others act towards you can shape your feelings of belonging and your feelings of participating that I feel link with this. There is so much to say and so much to do around the issues of self, identity and identities. And there are so many different ways to address these issues. Once again I come back to what might be considered an ‘onion’ metaphor of identity, in which each layer represents a different level of understanding from the ‘inner-world’ to the ‘outer-world’, although I’m not sure that ‘onion’ is a suitable metaphor when we want to think of interactions! Bringing Marcia’s work2 into the conversation makes sense, especially when considering the possibility that identities are re-formed when we hit ‘rocky bits’– when our confidence is tested if not shattered. It leads me to conclude that identity is ‘rebuilt’ as self-efficacy is solidified ‘after a fall’. I suspect lots of this goes on during clerkships. I will look for the Helmich et al.24 paper. I also really like your onion metaphor and believe we could use it to bring our ideas together meaningfully.

However, in order for these programs to work as intended, stigma related to HPV and cervical cancer must be understood and addressed. We explored pre-existing stigma associated with HPV and cervical cancer in the public healthcare system of a low-resource setting prior to implementation of an HPV screen-and-treat program. Methods This study conducted thematic analysis of data collected during implementation of a novel HPV screen-and-treat system for cervical cancer early detection and treatment in Iquitos, Peru. We included 35 semi-structured interviews (19 health professionals, 16 women with cervical precancer or cancer), eight focus groups (70 community women), one workshop (14 health professionals), 210 counseling observations (with 20 nurse-midwives), and a document review. We used the Socio-Ecological Model to organize the analysis. Results We identified three main themes: 1. the implication that women are to blame for their HPV infection through characterizations of being easy or promiscuous, 2. the implication that men are to blame for women’s HPV infections through being considered careless or unfaithful, 3. HPV is shameful, embarrassing, and something that should be hidden from others. Consequently, in some cases, women refrained from getting screened for HPV. These themes were seen at the individual level among women, relationship level among women, men, and family members, community level among healthcare staff, and societal level within components of cervical cancer guidelines and male chauvinism. Conclusions Cervical cancer early detection and treatment programs in limited resource settings must address stigma entrenched throughout the entire healthcare system in order to sustainably and successfully implement and scale-up new programs. Interventions to tackle this stigma can incorporate messages about HPV infections and latency to lessen the focus on the influence of sexual behavior on HPV acquisition, and instead, promote screening and treatment as paramount preventative measures.""}"

Ableism, “compulsory able-bodiedness” (Campbell, 2009; McRuer, 2013), will be used as an interrogative tool to aid in the ‘outing’ of the ‘able’: to tease out the values and principles undergirding this exclusionary perception of motherhood. As such I will be drawing on autoethnographic material, in conjunction with a Studies in Ableism (SiA; Campbell, 2009) approach to analyse the bypassing of disabled mothers and to suggest tentative ways forward. In the UK 1.7 million parents identify as disabled (Morris &amp;amp; Wates, 2006) and perhaps many more would do so if there were no fear of censure (see, especially, Booth &amp;amp; Booth, 2005; Llewellyn, McConell, &amp;amp; Ferronato, 2003; Sheerin, 2001; Swain, French, &amp;amp; Cameron, 2003) and their requirements need to be recognised, heard and provided for in the consumer market.

Methods: By combining the vast bioinformatic datasets analyses of BLCA and the experimental verification on clinical BLCA specimen, we identified the expressions and biological functions of OAS gene family members in BLCA with comparison to normal bladder tissues. Results: We showed that the expression levels of OAS gene family members were higher in BLCA than in normal bladder tissues. The expression levels of most OAS genes had correlations with prognosis, genomic mutation, methylation and infiltration levels of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in the microenvironment of BLCA. In addition, high expression levels of OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OASL predicted better overall survival in BLCA patients. Conclusions: We conclude that the expression levels of OAS genes may be considered as a signature of BLCA and can reflect immune cell infiltration in BLCA microenvironment and predict the overall survival of BLCA.

In the current study, we examined whether chronic metabolic acidosis, which increases ammonia metabolism, alters the cell-specific and/or the subcellular expression of the ammonia transporter family member, Rhcg, in the outer medullary collecting duct in the inner stripe (OMCDi). Chronic metabolic acidosis was induced in normal SD rats by HCl ingestion for 7 days; controls were pair-fed. The subcellular distribution of Rhcg was determined using immunogold electron microscopy and morphometric analyses. In intercalated cells, acidosis increased total Rhcg, apical plasma membrane Rhcg, and the proportion of total cellular Rhcg in the apical plasma membrane. Intracellular Rhcg decreased significantly, and basolateral Rhcg was unchanged. Because apical plasma membrane length increased in parallel with apical Rhcg immunolabel, apical plasma membrane Rhcg density was unchanged. In principal cells, acidosis increased total Rhcg, apical plasma membrane Rhcg, and the proportion of total cellular Rhcg in the apical plasma membrane while decreasing the intracellular proportion. In contrast to the intercalated cell, chronic metabolic acidosis did not significantly alter apical boundary length; accordingly, apical plasma membrane Rhcg density increased. In addition, basolateral Rhcg immunolabel increased in response to chronic metabolic acidosis. These results indicate that in the rat OMCDi 1) chronic metabolic acidosis increases apical plasma membrane Rhcg in both the intercalated cell and principal cell where it may contribute to enhanced apical ammonia secretion; 2) increased apical plasma membrane Rhcg results from both increased total protein and changes in the subcellular distribution of Rhcg; 3) the mechanism of Rhcg subcellular redistribution differs in intercalated and principal cells; and 4) Rhcg may contribute to regulated basolateral ammonia transport in the principal cell.""}"

Methods Integrated analyses leveraged Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017–2021 data (204 countries; n = 23,487 sources) and US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (n = 900 adults). GBD-estimated disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to childhood sexual abuse/bullying victimization employed DisMod-MR 2.1, CODEm, and geospatial frameworks. Longitudinal trends used linear mixed-effects models with Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation. NHANES analyses deployed Gaussian graphical models (GGMs), restricted cubic splines (RCS), and ensemble machine learning (XGBoost/Random Forest) to delineate socio-behavioral correlates, nonlinear exposure-response relationships, and symptom network architecture. Results Adolescents in low Socio-demographic Index (SDI) regions bore the highest sexual abuse-attributable DALY burden (32,090; 95% UI:29,266–35,120) with 4.38%/year growth, while high-SDI regions exhibited rising abuse burden (+ 1.41%/year) alongside declining bullying-attributable disability (− 0.62%/year). Geospatial analysis revealed Egypt (204.48 DALYs/100,000), the US (249.11), and Greenland (395.80) as critical hotspots. US state-level analyses demonstrated alarming divergences: sexual abuse-attributable DALYs increased universally (+ 1.14%/year), eclipsing bullying reductions (− 0.89%/year), with females sustaining 6.3-fold higher abuse-related disability rates by 2021. NHANES stratification identified severe depression concentrated in younger, economically disadvantaged adults (income-to-poverty ratio: 0.73 vs. 3.55; *p &lt; 0.001). Poverty-sedentary behavior interactions synergistically increased severe depression risk (OR = 1.005; 95%CI:1.001–1.009; *p = 0.013). Symptom networks identified depressed mood (strength = 0.92) and anhedonia as central nodes, with suicidal ideation bridging affective and cognitive clusters. Machine learning confirmed PHQ-9 severity as the dominant risk predictor (|SHAP|=0.42), outperforming socio-behavioral factors. RCS models revealed J-shaped sedentary behavior-depression relationships, steepening below poverty thresholds (OR = 1.52; 95%CI:1.38–1.68). Conclusion Childhood sexual abuse drives escalating global depression disability—unmitigated by current public health interventions—with distinct socio-behavioral vulnerability pathways. Symptom network topology and nonlinear exposure-response dynamics identify critical targets for precision prevention. Urgent recalibration of child protection policies is warranted to address this diverging burden epidemic.""}"

The primary cause of this condition is mostly linked to persistent infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), which are recognized for their ability to promote the development of cancer. Due to HPV infection, both therapeutic and preventative HPV vaccinations have been developed. Therapeutic vaccines can eradicate viruses and virus-infected cells by stimulating cellular immunity. Notwithstanding the availability of preventive HPV vaccinations, HPV screening, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the therapeutic effect on cervical cancer patients is limited. Therefore, therapeutic vaccines have emerged as a new treatment option. The cancer-causing proteins E6 and E7, which are consistently detected in cervical cancer and precancerous lesions, are crucial in the progression and sustenance of cervical cancer. Consequently, these cancer-causing proteins present an encouraging opportunity for the research and creation of therapeutic cervical cancer vaccines.

Current existing drugs cause several side effects and resistance, the identification of new therapeutic targets for the development of new drugs is necessary. The vesicular trafficking in the parasite flagellar pocket is essential for parasite survival and proliferation, but little is known about the proteins involved in the endocytic/secretory pathways. In this work, we are describing the characterization of a transporter cargo protein SFT-2/Got-1 like in Leishmania infantum. Material and Methods: Using bioinformatics tools, the putative Got-1 protein A4HSK3 was characterized structurally and phylogenetically. Molecular biology was used to clone and express the protein and confocal fluorescence to determine its subcellular localization. Results: The Got-1 like protein presents four alpha helix TM conserved domains (aa38-aa147) characteristics of the Got-1/SFT-2 family proteins and an important Pen-2 conserved motif LGDYXXF located in the extracellular loop. Confocal microscopy suggests that Got-1/SFT-2 like is localized in the flagellar pocket, and is partially co-localized with the L. infantum presenilin-like protein. Phylogenetically, the Leishmania sp Got-1 like is contained in a subgroup of proteins clearly detached from the other Trypanosomatidae, such as T. cruzi and T. brucei. Conclusions: Our data show the presence of an important transported proteins, and its colocalization with the presenilin aspartyl protease in the flagellar pocket of the L. infantum open new perspectives to identify novel targets, which can be an alternative therapeutic strategy against leishmaniasis.""}"

L'Ivoirienne. L'Harmattan, 2020. ISBN 978-2-343-20214-3. Pp. 201. Habitée par une famille excentrique, les Magnanime, L'Ivoirienne est un château décoré par des motifs d'éléphants, car son propriétaire est passionné d'éléphants. C'est dans ce château fabuleux, éponyme du roman, que nous plonge François-Marie Pons dans son deuxième roman. L'enfance et la vie de Rémi Quentin, le personnage principal du roman, se construisent par sa fascination pour ce château. Un événement annonce le début de son parcours tragique: Rémi doit désormais arrêter ses visites au château pour se faire une vie ailleurs. Or, la tâche s'avère difficile car tout le roman se base sur sa tentative de libération de l'influence de L'Ivoirienne. Le roman s'ouvre par l'annonce d'une année sabbatique pour Rémi, le début d'une période de confrontation au passé qui l'a marqué à jamais. Cette période coïncide avec sa rencontre avec Iris et son attachement à elle, ce qui va le motiver à continuer ses épreuves dans sa quête de soi. Le roman met l'accent sur l'aspect néfaste et transformatif des secrets: \""La vérité dissimulée est un mensonge si lourd à porter\"" (161). Les personnages subissent l'impact de leurs secrets qui ne s'effacent jamais, mais continuent plutôt à exister sous diverses formes. Les personnages souffrent, et leur souffrance est toujours liée aux non-dits, même si, paradoxalement, la parole ne permet plus d'effacer les conséquences. Dans ce sens, Pons fait le portrait d'un cercle vicieux qui emprisonne l'homme, et ce, pour créer une prise de conscience de la nature humaine. Le lecteur ne suit pas uniquement l'histoire de Rémi Quentin qui évolue tout au long de l'histoire, mais témoigne également de l'évolution des autres personnages autour de [End Page 259] leurs secrets. La structure fragmentée du récit permet au narrateur de faire entendre la voix des autres personnages et de montrer à quel point les non-dits peuvent influencer chacun de manières différentes. Pons attire l'attention sur les questions existentielles qui sont au centre de la vie humaine et qui ont une teneur de silence: la culpabilité, les mensonges, l'amour et la religion. Une série de réflexions sur la condition humaine, tout au long des passages fragmentés du roman, fait que l'univers fabuleux de L'Ivoirienne se présente comme un espace de partage entre les personnages du roman et les lecteurs. Ainsi, la citation d'Éric Berne introduite dans la préface du roman—\""Nous sommes tous nés princes. La vie nous a transformés en grenouille\""—annonce l'optimisme à travers la possibilité d'un nouveau voyage à la fin du roman: une fin ouverte qui implique le renouvellement. Pons invite ainsi son lecteur à faire un double voyage: d'une part, celui de son personnage principal; de l'autre, le voyage en soi-même. Dans ce sens, L'Ivoirienne se présente comme un roman d'apprentissage où le lecteur entame la découverte de soi—qui n'exclut peutêtre pas la catharsis—et qui permet le rétablissement et la réinvention dont chacun a besoin pour survivre aux problèmes liés à sa condition humaine.

Specifically, it is argued that innovative V2 arises when acquirers postulate a novel clause type characterized by a left-edge operator, which they analyse as a V2 environment by analogy with other non-declarative clause types involving such structures (e.g. interrogatives). This finds support from other cases of innovative V2 in English, Scots, and Afrikaans.

The findings from bound sets have been applied to achieve the synchronization between two chaotic systems. Furthermore, this paper introduces a novel 4D-chaotic system of fractional-order. For varying the parameter values, the dynamical behavior of the fractional system is analyzed and Hamilton energy function, Lyapunov exponents, time series and bifurcation diagrams are also discussed. Finally, Mittag-Leffler globally attractive sets and Mittag-Leffler positively invariant sets of the fractional system are determined.

Methods: Retrospective analysis of SDAVF patients in a period of three years (2019 to 2021) who presented with progressive paraparesis, bladder symptoms, and/or sensory disturbances. They were evaluated by MRI and localization of the fistula was done by spinal catheter angiogram. Spinal AV fistulas were simply classified as extradural and intradural. They all underwent microsurgical shunt interruption. Neurological function was evaluated by Aminoff-Logue Scale (ALS). Individual ALS scores of each patient (pretreatment and post-treatment) were recorded to find out the p-value of the surgical intervention. Results: A total of 20 patients (mean age 35 ± 10 years, 16 (80.0%) are male. The mean interval from onset to diagnosis was 6 ± 3 months. Among the anatomical location of fistulas, 1(05.0%) was cervical, 16 (80.0%) were in thoracic, and 3 (15.0%) were lumbar.

The AEP forms a critical interface between the mineral phase of teeth (hydroxyapatite) and the oral microbial biofilm. This biofilm is the key feature responsible for the development of dental caries. Fluoride on enamel surface is well known to reduce caries by reducing the solubility of enamel to acid. Information on the effects of fluoride on AEP formation is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of fluoride treatment on hydroxyapatite on the subsequent formation of AEP. In addition, this study pioneered the use of label-free quantitative proteomics to better understand the composition of AEP proteins. Hydroxyapatite discs were randomly divided in 4 groups (n = 10 per group). Each disc was exposed to distilled water (control) or sodium fluoride solution (1, 2 or 5%) for 2 hours. Discs were then washed and immersed in human saliva for an additional 2 hours. AEP from each disc was collected and subjected to liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for protein identification, characterization and quantification. A total of 45 proteins were present in all four groups, 12 proteins were exclusively present in the control group and another 19 proteins were only present in the discs treated with 5% sodium fluoride. Relative proteomic quantification was carried out for the 45 proteins observed in all four groups. Notably, the concentration of important salivary proteins, such as statherin and histatin 1, decrease with increasing levels of fluoride. It suggests that these proteins are repulsed when hydroxyapatite surface is coated with fluoride. Our data demonstrated that treatment of hydroxyapatite with fluoride (at high concentration) qualitatively and quantitatively modulates AEP formation, effects which in turn will likely impact the formation of oral biofilms.""}"

There is, however, a rather critical lack of understanding of the way these three central areas of Stuart politics impinged on each other and the way in which they interacted. The patron/client struggles at court had far-reaching ramifications for the power balances of the county hierarchies and both worked to dictate which men would sit in Parliament and w h o m and what they would represent there. The ways in which this worked and the evolutionary process of these relationships during the reign of James I, particularly, are largely misunderstood and yet it is only through an examination of the roles of allegiance and patronage in these three areas that any true understanding can be gained of the quite fundamental changes in the make-up of political relations during the early years of the Stuarts. In order to try to explain the events of the 1620s, more recent historical scholarship has placed a renewed emphasis on the roles of the patron in the House of Lords and the client in the House of Commons. Such scholarship has not gone unchallenged and it has become obvious that there wiU not be a widely acceptable thesis explaining the politics of that decade until w e have a fuller understanding of the period which preceded it. The historians of the 1620s are working with far too few reliable reference points from the earlier period and in absolutely vital matters such as patron/client relationships in the context of Parliaments, our knowledge of the early part of James I's reign is still woefully incomplete. A s a result, historians have been unable to make the sort of meaningful comparisons which need to be made before a more complete understanding of the reign can be found. N o satisfactory picture of those troublesome Parliaments of the 1620s can be gained until w e have a greater understanding of what really occurred in the preceding Parliaments, particularly that of 1604-10. O n this point, at least, there is validity in the arguments of J.H. Hexter and his fellow 'Revisers of Revisionism', as they seem to term themselves.1 Unfortunately it is in this area 'See J.H. Hexter, Power Struggle, Parliament and Liberty in Early Stuart England, Journal of Modern History 50, no. 1, 1978, 42, 47; D. Hirst, Parliament, Law and War in the 1620s, review article, Historical Journal 23, no. 2, 1980, 457; and T.K. Rabb, The Role of the Commons, in Revisionism Revised: Two Perspectives on Early Stuart Parliamentary History, Past and Present 92, August 1981, 67. Rabb gives a concise bibliography of the principal revisionist publications, the most important of which are C. Russell, Parliamentary History in Perspective 1604-1629, History 61, 1976; K. Sharpe, ed., Faction and Parliament, Essays on 122 S. Hollings of gaining a better understanding of what preceded the 1620s that both the revisionists and their revisers have failed to make headway, to the detriment of aU their arguments. The first quite central point that can be made from an examination of patronage relations in thefirsthalf of James' reign is that they were in very great contrast to those operating in the latter years of the reign.2 This was particularly so when the way patronage relations interacted with Parliament is examined and the early years of James' reign provides a rather surprising picture, but one which makes the events of the 1620s far more explicable. Obviously not all patronage relations can be uncovered, but what evidence survives is most compelling. The essential relations for government, both in Parliament and outside of it, were the relations between the leading courtiers and the county governors. This latter group sat in Parliament as a virtual right because of their position in the counties and acted as the JPs and deputy lieutenants carrying out royal policy in the counties. It was the views of these county governors which dictated whether government could be workable or well nigh impossible. Throughout James' reign the attitude these men held when...""}"

En efecto, pensamos que este lenguaje es en el contexto de la literatura uruguaya e inclusive latinoamericana , una de las más terminantes rupturas con el canon realista y mimético; y consecuentemente, una propuesta inédita en la visión del mundo , que se ofrece más amplia, más contradictoria, inquisitiva e inquietante que la tradicional. Nuestro esfuerzo se encaminará, entonces, a distinguir las particularidades textuales que vehiculan o más precisamente, que constituyen dicha visión. 1.0. En primer lugar trabajaremos con Caza de conejos (1986), un libro extraño y poderosamente orgánico, por encima de la autonomía evidente de cada una de sus unidades narrativas. Este volumen se compone de cien breves núcleos de historias independientes (en el sentido de que no se prolongan ni desarrollan entre sí, de modo que cada una presenta su propia dinámica y su propio proceso enterizamente), individualizados con números romanos . De todos modos, esas cien historias —dada su extrema brevedad, en algunos casos se trata apenas de notaciones narrativas— comparten una serie de elementos comunes y característicos. Esos elementos constantes son los sujetos de la historia y el espacio representado en el que se mueven: un grupo de cazadores que vive en un castillo y que con frecuencia se dirijen a un bosque cercano a cazar conejos por el placer de la caza y de la comida. Los acompaña una joven extraña y sensual, Laura; un idiota, paradojalmente el organizador de las partidas; y suelen colaborar con la empresa músicos y magos. En cambio, los guardabosques son sus enemigos. En general, los roles actanciales se disponen según el siguiente esquema: función protagónica ______ objeto _______ destino cazadores ,^--*conejos *-~^. placer adyuvanteantagonista músicosguardabosques magos 01996 NUEVO TEXTO CRITICO Vol. VIII No. 16/17 Julio 1995 a Junio 1996 36________________________________________________________ROMULO COSSE Naturalmente que sobre la base de este modelo, el texto presenta distintas variantes, que no hacen otra cosa que destacar por oposición, el esquema relacional dominante. En cierto modo podría definirse una ley concerniente a la historia, como la exposición de un modelo actorial y un número limitado de sus variables posibles. (Por ejemplo, en XIII, el conejo asume el rol de protagonista; él desarrolla motrizmente la acción y él es en rigor el cazador que devora al hombre, esta vez, su presa. Entre las constantes que consolidan la unidad del libro, por encima de la diversidad de sus núcleos narrativos, hay que destacar un factor constructivo absolutamente estable en la figura del narrador representado como uno de los cazadores. Merced a la elección de este relator, ocurre una jerarquizaci ón recíproca de funciones: el rol privilegiado del comunicador de conocimientos (narrador), se ve fortificado a través de su identificación con el sujeto ejecutor de las transformaciones narrativas (protagonista). Dos roles relacionalmente fuertes, pues, se combinan y enfatizan, lo cual tiende a conferir un estatus canónico y sacralizado a una historia culturalmente subversiva , puesto que la voz que articula el informe narrativo, la voz que modela la visión del mundo, es la del propio cazador de conejos. De modo que al acentuarse la perspectiva del cazador, que adquiere un carácter hegemónico en el universo de la ficción, la transgresión cultural que significa la caza inclusive salvaje y sangrienta de los conejos, surge más nítida y destacada. Pero esto es ya otro tema y lo veremos enseguida. Mientras, hay que decir, que las regularidades estructurales rápidamente vistas hasta ahora (todo lo concerniente a las funciones del relato), son las que con mayor facilidad pueden percibirse en una primera lectura, ya que corresponden al plano de la historia y su organización y se resuelven por otra parte con bastante sencillez.

Hair specimens were collected by plucking out with the roots intact, and these specimens were prepped by an optimized procedure based on freeze-sectioning to detect the drug inside the hair shaft and hair root. Time-course changes in the imaging results, with confirmatory quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis for each 1-mm segment of single hair strands, revealed a substantial concentration of the drug first onto the hair bulbs after ingestion, while only a small portion appeared to be incorporated into the hair matrix, forming a 2-3 mm distinctive drug band with tailing. Comparable amount of the drug also appeared to be incorporated into the keratinized hair shaft in the upper dermis zone, forming another distinct drug band of about 2 mm, which both moved toward the distal side, following the strand's growth rate.

Positive Einstellungen zu Inklusion gelten als zentraler Erfolgsfaktor für die Entwicklung eines inklusiven Schulsystems.

Zur Validierung herangezogene externe Konstrukte sind Selbstwirksamkeit und die Big Five Persönlichkeitsfaktoren. Die Ergebnisse einer Befragung von 556 Lehrkräften und Lehramtsstudierenden (Alter: M‍( SD) = 26.48 (12.67); 70 % weiblich) mit Blick auf die Inklusion von Kindern mit Förderschwerpunkt Lernen (SPF-L) zeigen eine weitgehend gute Replizierbarkeit der Faktorstrukturen der Instrumente. Die Faktorkorrelationen über die Instrumente hinweg lagen zwischen |.61| und |.96| (nur Attitude Subskala des SACIE). Alle Subskalen zeigen vergleichbare Zusammenhänge mit Selbstwirksamkeit und den Big Five Persönlichkeitsfaktoren. Zwar weisen Unterschiede in den Effektstärken darauf hin, dass die Instrumente je spezifische Aspekte von Inklusion betonen, insgesamt rechtfertigen die Ergebnisse jedoch die Annahme, dass das zugrundeliegende Konzept von Einstellungen bezüglich Inklusion weitgehend überlappt.""}"

Two bask lay conceptions of citizenship are hypothesised to guide and justify perceived legitimacy of social rights. A consensus-based conception of citizenship is grounded on membership in a group that expects endorsement of common values. Group norms distinguish acceptable from unacceptable behavior, and principles of deservingness define the scope of rights. Social rights acquire their legitimacy as devices to enforce common values. In contrast, a conflict-based conception of citizenship is grounded on a structural and hierarchical perception of the group Social rights arc seen as devices to challenge existing power relationships, and their justification lies in social change. Results show how attitudes towards maternity policies arc related to social order, common group values, structural gender inequality and social change. Positioning on consensus-based citizenship predicted attitudes towards a restrictive (means-tested) maternity policy, whereas positioning towards conflict-based citizenship predicted attitudes towards unconditional and extensive policies (e g., day nurseries and maternity leave). It is concluded that favourable attitudes towards maintenance or expansion of social rights in general, and of women's rights in particular, largely depend on perceptions of groups not in terms of their essential differences, but in terms of social inequalities.""}"

A recent hypothesis the author put forward was that professional moneylenders are a structural phenomenon of expanding merchant capitalism, and that once the market integration of particular regions has been achieved, professional moneylenders are eventually replaced by banks. Alongside such large-scale professional moneylenders there have always been and still are various small-scale and mostly semi-professional moneylenders. In the contemporary world they are found in great numbers in developing countries. They have been interpreted as structurally supporting capitalism because they provide marginalised people who are beyond the scope of banks with purchasing power for the commodity markets based upon credit. In this paper the author compares large-scale professional moneylenders of precolonial/colonial India and colonial Indonesia. The analysis shows that particularly non-Western bankers emerged in India, while in Indonesia comparable financial agents seem to have existed only in limited numbers. What seems to speak against the above hypothesis can be interpreted as follows. While the structure of expanding merchant capitalism provides a framework in which such non-Western bankers may emerge, the particular world market integration of trade during the expansion period and colonial policy may develop different financial landscapes with regard to economic opportunities for private enterprise.""}"

Defined as a injury that disturbs neurological functions, concussion is characterised by a constellation of signs and symptoms. However, clinical imaging methods do not reveal any structural damage. Recently, neurophysiological techniques such as single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are being applied to quantify neurophysiological changes (specifically corticospinal and intracortical excitation and intracortical inhibition) following concussion; both from an acute perspective, but also to investigate chronic changes associated with concussion injuries. The aim of this review paper is to present a systematic review and qualitative review on studies using TMS to assess concussion. Specifically, questions addressed refer to the efficacy of single and paired-pulse TMS on quantifying changes in neurophysiology following acute concussion and long-term changes in those with a history of repeated head trauma. &lt;bold&gt;&lt;italic&gt;Methods&lt;/italic&gt;:&lt;/bold&gt; Systematic searching of relevant databases for peer-reviewed literature between 1985 to present day. A qualitative synthesis of studies attaining the inclusion criteria was conducted. &lt;bold&gt;&lt;italic&gt;Results&lt;/italic&gt;:&lt;/bold&gt; Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. TMS study checklist rated studies of moderate to high methodological quality, with all but five studies being observational between-group design. Nine studies reported short-term data following concussion, with seven of the nine studies reporting alterations in intracortical inhibition. Thirteen studies reported long-term changes in those with persistent symptoms or chronic changes with history of head trauma. Six of 11 studies presented changes in intracortical inhibition with single pulse. Eleven studies presented paired-pulse data; intracortical facilitation was reported in two studies, while one study reporting short-interval intracotrical facilitation. All but one study reported intracortical inhibition measures, with the majority of these studies showing differences in long-interval intracortical inhibition differences between older individuals with a history of head trauma compared to age-matched controls. &lt;bold&gt;&lt;italic&gt;Conclusions&lt;/italic&gt;:&lt;/bold&gt; This review demonstrates that TMS is a reliable and sophisticated technique to measure the neurophysiology of concussion. While further studies are required to establish effectiveness TMS as a clinical tool for mild brain injury, the potential of TMS to reliably quantify cortical activity offers exciting opportunities to provide objective measures for concussion diagnosis and prognosis.""}"

Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) was developed in the 1970s, and tracers suitable for the imaging of regional cerebral perfusion (rCP) became available in the 1980s. The method was first used to study rCP in the interictal phase, and this showed areas of low perfusion in a proportion of cases, mainly in patients with temporal lobe epilepsies. However, the trapping paradigm of tracers such as hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) provided a practicable method of studying changes in rCP during seizures, and a literature was established in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing a typical sequence of changes during and after seizures of mesial temporal lobe origin; the ictal phase was associated with large increases in perfusion throughout the temporal lobe, with first the lateral, then the mesial temporal lobe becoming hypoperfused in the postictal phase. Activation and inhibition of other structures, such as the basal ganglia and frontal cortex, were also seen. Studies of seizures originating elsewhere in the brain have shown a variety of patterns of change, according to the structures involved. These changes have been used practically to aid the process of localisation of the epileptogenic zone so that epilepsy surgery can be planned. Some neuroreceptors (e.g. benzodiazepine receptors) can be studied using SPECT, and have shown localised abnormalities. SPECT has also been used to study brain function during the intracarotid amytal test. SPECT images of all kinds can be analysed using numerical techniques such as statistical parametric mapping, and such techniques promise to improve the yield of information from ictal studies.""}"

This system converts translational kinetic energy from the displacement of electrodes between electrolyte phases into electrical energy, achieving a peak power of 6.4 ± 0.08 μW cm<sup>-2</sup>, with a peak voltage of 96 mV and peak current density of 183 μA cm<sup>-2</sup> using a 300 Ω load. This load is several thousand times smaller than those typically employed in conventional methods.

Also, the system provides a continuous current flow of approximately 5 μA cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.005 Hz for 23 cycles without performance decay.

We spoke to Professor Xiao Ma, one of the authors, to find out more about his and his team's latest work. My research interests include channel coding, information theory, and their applications. While our mobile devices are becoming smaller but providing more functions, people require more reliable transmission to guarantee real-time demands. On the other hand, more and more smart devices will access the Internet. It becomes a challenge to build a network framework to utilise the network resource fully. I was very interested in developing superposition coding and transmission which provides an efficient way to utilise channel resource and gain more performance. Professor Xiao Ma from Sun Yat-sen University in China The proposed decoding algorithm SCL-based IEDA (red) performs well compared to other popular algorithms Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can be seen as a special Internet of Things (IoT). Using information interaction among vehicles, humans and the roadside unite. IoV helps people to collect real-time traffic information and gain more convenience and comfort. Since more and more cars and other vehicles are used daily by people, a large number of devices require access to the IoVs. Different from traditional IoT communication, IoV is deployed to transmit rapidly and reliably the road condition information (e.g. traffic jam notifications) in most cases. With IoV communication, we can build autonomous vehicles and improve travel safety and convenience. In the non-orthogonal overlapping transmission system in this Letter, we use power allocation to distinguish two signals from different relay nodes. In the destination node, we present a successive cancellation list based interference elimination decoding algorithm (SCL-based IEDA) for information recovery. Instead of outputting a single pair of estimated information sequences using a traditional SCL decoder, our decoding algorithm outputs more alternative pairs of estimated information sequences and picks up the most probable one. The significance of our work is that we can recover information from the overlapped signals by the presented decoding algorithms, even if the signals are highly overlapped in the same time slot and frequency band. By power allocation, we distinguish the signals so that the information in the highly overlapped signals is recoverable. Our scheme can not only be applied to the mentioned application scenario in this paper, but also be extended to other many-to-one communication networks to improve the throughput of the network. The long term impacts of this work mainly include: 1) With polar code being selected for the 5G standard, this work will attract more people to pay attention to polar code and its application in multi-user transmission systems. 2) The Internet of Vehicles is regarded as one of the typical 5G application scenarios of URLLC, which requires a transmission with high reliability and low latency. The polar code-based overlapping transmission scheme may find applications in improving the transmission efficiency in IoVs. Our further plans for developing this work include：1) Try to improve the decoding algorithm of the proposed overlapping transmission. 2) Consider the case when more than two signals from different relay nodes are overlapped and study the corresponding decoding algorithms for information recovery. 3) Conduct simulations under a more complex and practical wireless channel model to further investigate the information recovery performance of the proposed decoding algorithm. Currently, we are actively working on the above mentioned plans. As we all know, dedicated short range communications were used for vehicle communications in the US. On the other hand, EN 202 663 was used in Europe. However, due to the limited range and low speed transmission, research attempts have been made on cellular based Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) communications. The benefits of C-V2X communication, compared to prior technologies, are that it can accommodate more users, provide faster transmission speed, and is of lower latency performance. As part of the evolution of cellular communications, the forthcoming fifth generation, V2X (5G-V2X), communications will further leverage this trend. In the coming ten years, it is believed that along with new energy resources, automatic driving, accurate image detection, and three-dimensional scene reconstruction technologies, C-V2X will further leverage the driving experience and rebuild the car industry. Although C-V2X has been widely discussed in literature, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done before its application, for instance, frequency bandwidth allocation and its effective usage, precise vehicle transmission channel measurement and modelling, seamless wireless connection for massive connected devices (vehicles, pedestrians, etc.), URLLC, even fast speed transmissions for in-car entertainment, vehicle network security and flexible network architecture for fast moving vehicles.""}"

More than 25 large, permineralized structures are scattered over an area of ∼1200 m2. These are commonly convex to elongated, helicoidal to concentric, calcium carbonate–rich structures, 30–60 cm high and 60–120 cm wide. Permineralized squid beaks and altered organic matter occur inside these structures. Preliminary chemical data reveal the presence of organic molecules compatible with the degradation of cellular lipids, whose cholic acids indicate the presence of mammalian gastric or intestinal activity; eight free amino acids were also found. The results allow the identification of these structures as intestinal products of sperm whales living ∼1.75 m.y. ago. The described fossil structures represent the only known example of Pleistocene sperm whale coprolites.

But the former's analytical solution is very complicated, while the latter's cut-and-try methcd requires a great deal of labour.In this paper, the author assumed the load distribution as a sine function including two arbitrary constants, which are so varied as to satisfy the condition of pinion deformations, i. e., the summation of pinion bending deflection, pinion torsional deformation and tooth bending deflection is always constant along a pinion axis.This approximate solution, being sufficiently accurate for engineering purpose and very simple, briefly concludes that the most adequate length of pinion is twice of pitch circle diameter of pinion in ordinary tooth stiffness.Another fundamental problem is the tooth lubrication.This problem has been treated by K. Yokoyama and E. K. Gatcombe, but those investigations are only limited to the particular case of boundary conditions of oil film between tooth surfaces.In this paper, the author introduced a solution under more general boundary conditions, assuming that the oil film is in a stable condition when the frictional coefficient between tooth surfaces is minimum at a certain oil temperature.According to the author's opinion, the oil film should always exist between tooth surfaces and torque should be transmitted through this film.So the tooth load is to be limited in the range in which the oil film is in stable condition and expressed in following equation.P={6.74-3.48(2-ha1+ha2/Mn)}3√<U(d/1+1/R)2>where :P allowable maximum tooth load per pinion face width in kg/cm.ha1, ha2 pinion and wheel addendum.Mn module of gear.U peripheral velocity at pitch circle diameter in m/s.d pitch circle diameter of pinion in cm.R reduction ratio of gear.""}"

Design/methodology/approach The authors use publicly listed Indonesian firms that are included in the SRI-KEHATI Index as the sample. Further, by using NVIVO software, the authors qualitatively analyze CSR activities disclosed on firms’ social media and annual reports with an interpretive approach. Findings The findings indicate that Indonesian firms still exhibit early stages of social media-based voluntary CSR disclosure. Further, issues on training, education and skill building dominate firms’ disclosure. Finally, Indonesian firms disclose less CSR information in their social media than in their annual reports, thus confirming the early stages of social media-based CSR disclosure. Research limitations/implications The small sample size limits the generalizability of the results. Practical implications This paper provides insights on which CSR issues are commonly disclosed in firms’ social media. This study may also inform regulators the extent of disclosures that could be regulated in social media. Originality/value Social media-based CSR disclosure in developing countries is relatively understudied. Thus, this paper empirically shows the topic and intensity of CSR disclosure in social media and the comparison between this type of CSR disclosure with CSR disclosure using other media.""}"

The goals of this paper are to: 1. review factors that affect nighttime visibility, with an emphasis on driving, 2. provide the reader with online access to an automated modified Adrian/CIE visibility level (VL) calculator (VLC), and 3. suggest future research for enhancing the objective measurement of visibility. Recognizing that luminance contrast is the primary sensory determinant of nighttime visibility, several contrast-detection models have been proposed to quantify visibility in dim lighting. Of these, the Adrian (1989) model accounts for comparatively more of the important variables and has been the most widely accepted. The mathematical steps for calculating target VL in the modified Adrian/CIE model are presented and the VLC user interface is explained in step-by-step order. The VLC provides an easy-to-use tool for calculating target VL. Several additional factors that affect VL that are not currently included in the model provide important research opportunities for enhancing the measurement of target visibility in nighttime conditions. The VLC is an open-access application intended to foster the measurement of VL in professional practice and to foster research to advance the utility of the Adrian/CIE model.""}"

Desenvolver uma metodologia para a caracterização, preparo, moldagem, ensaios para determinação do coeficiente de atenuação linear experimental, calculo do coeficiente de atenuação linear teórico, e determinação do Z efetivo, culminando com a confecção de um banco de dados embrionário para os concretos de elevada massa específica preparados com matérias primas nacionais. Para tanto foram identificadas onze matérias primas produzidas no Brasil com caracteísticas adequadas para a produção de concretos de elevada densidade. Apresentamos os fundamentos teóricos ao bom entendimento do trabalho tanto no campo da proteção radiológica como naquela dos conceitos que podem ser usados para a produção de blindagem às radiações gama e X. Preparamos vinte e dois tipos de concretos de elevada massa específica com a utilização de matérias primas naturais e nacionais. Os concretos desenvolvidos foram preparados, moldados e ensaiados com uma fonte de 137Cs, de 3,7 1010 Bq (1Ci) de atividade. Foram calculados os coeficientes de atenuação linear com a utilização das análises químicas dos concretos preparados e encontrados os coeficientes de atenução linear experimentais para comparação e avaliação da técnica proposta. Foram medidas as massas específicas dos concretos preparados em virtude de sua importância para a formação da seção de choque do composto quando da predominância do efeito Compton, e determinado o Z efetivo para a região predominante do efeito fotoelétrico. Por fim foram calculados os custos de produção levando-se em conta somente os custos das matérias primas. Para as massas específicas os concretos apresentaram uma variação de 2,74 kg/dm3 até 3,76 kg/dm3, já para o coeficiente de atenuação linear experimental a variação foi de 0,2137 cm-1 a 0,2860 cm-1, o Z efetivo variou de 19 a 25. Finalizando o trabalho foram discutidos os resultados e sugeridos preferências de concretos para utilização em blindagens com a aplicação de alguns conceitos. Comparando os resultados encontrados com vários outros publicados em trabalhos internacionais, verificamos o grau de similaridade.\\n""}"

The scour depth decreases with an increase in submergence ratio. A submergence factor is introduced to determine the scour depth at a submerged cylinder from the information of the scour depth at an unsubmerged cylinder of the same diameter. In addition, the flow fields along the upstream vertical plane of symmetry of unsubmerged and submerged cylinders are presented through vector plots, which reveal that the dimension and strength of the horseshoe vortex decreases with an increase in submergence ratio. The horseshoe vortex circulations, which decrease with an increase in submergence ratio, are computed from the vorticity contours by using the Stokes theorem.""}"

Female flies from the overwintering generation oviposited en masse during late‐June and the result was a well‐synchronized growth of larvae in the first summer generation. Within this, and other generations, there was A wide range of emergence times for adults; they could emerge early and were then relatively small, or could emerge later and were then relatively large. Females were always larger than males and the emergence of flies was protandrous. A very similar pattern of growth and emergence times was found at a site in Finland. In all generations, sex ratio was biased to males and the sex ratio in each generation was inversely correlated with population density. This ensured that there were sufficient males emerging, and surviving adult mortality, to guarantee fertilisation of the females which were more expensive to produce.""}"

The paper concludes with lessons learned—more specifically, policy amendments—that are necessary to keep extraordinary rendition as a viable tool for the Obama Administration and mitigate political fallout against the United States from both its allies and enemies. This paper argues that extraordinary rendition provides flexibility to policymakers to detain terrorists in cases where an attack may be forthcoming and when other approved legal processes are slow to react. Therefore, instead of ending extraordinary renditions altogether, the United States should reevaluate how it implements the policy on a tactical, operational, and strategic level and amend it based on the recommendations put forward in this article.""}"

The efficiency of industrial crossbreeding of Large White pigs with Landrace and Pietrain meat breeds has been clarified. The reproductive capacity of sows after crossing with boars of different breeds, growth and development and fattening qualities of piglets of different genotypes were studied in a comparative aspect. Six experimental groups of pigs were formed for the experiment: Group I – purebred Large White breed, Group II – Landrace breed and Group III – Pietrain breed. Groups IV and V included crossbreeds IV – ½ Large White × ½ Landrace and V – ½ Large White × ½ Pietrain, respectively. Group VI is represented by three-breed hybrid animals: ¼ Large White × ¼ Landrace × ½ Pietrain. Such a scheme is due to obtaining crossbreds with high growth energy and good meat qualities. According to the indicators of growth and development, crossbred piglets had better dynamics during the entire growing period. At the end of fattening, the animals of Groups IV and VI exceeded their purebred contemporaries of the Large White breed in terms of reaching a body weight of 100 kg 10 and 8 days faster. The best slaughter yield had pigs of Group VI – ¼ Large White × ¼ Landrace × ½ Pietrain. A high indicator had also animals of Group IV – ½ Large White × ½ Landrace. In general, crossbred pigs obtained from different combinations of breeds ½ Large White × ½ Landrace and ¼ Large White × ¼ Landrace × ½ Pietrain exceeded their peers of purebred origin in terms of reproductive capacity and indicators of growth and development of piglets. During the research, it was also found that the half-carcass length was better in crossbreeds of the Landrace breed. Landraces also had a positive effect on the index of spigot thickness. The area of the “muscle eye” and the mass of the rear third of the half-carcass were significantly influenced by the Pietrain breed.""}"

Recently both M-like cells and dendritic cells have been discovered in the intestine of rainbow trout. It is therefore likely that antigens reaching the intestine can be taken up and thereby induce immunity in orally vaccinated fish. The objective of this project was to investigate whether oral and anal vaccination of rainbow trout induces protection against an experimental waterborne infection with the pathogenic enterobacteria Yersinia ruckeri O1 biotype 1 the causative agent of enteric redmouth disease (ERM). Rainbow trout were orally vaccinated with AquaVac ERM Oral (MERCK Animal Health) or an experimental vaccine bacterin of Y. ruckeri O1. Both vaccines were tested with and without a booster vaccination four months post the primary vaccination. Furthermore, two groups of positive controls were included, one group receiving the experimental oral vaccine in a 50 times higher dose, and the other group receiving a single dose administered anally in order to bypass the stomach. Each group was bath challenged with 6.3 × 10(8) CFU/ml Y. ruckeri, six months post the primary vaccination. The challenge induced significant mortality in all the infected groups except for the groups vaccinated anally with a single dose or orally with the high dose of bacterin. Both of these groups had 100% survival. These results show that a low dose of Y. ruckeri bacterin induces full protection when the bacterin is administered anally. Oral vaccination also induces full protection, however, at a dose 50 times higher than if the fish were to be vaccinated anally. This indicates that much of the orally fed antigen is digested in the stomach before it reaches the second segment of the intestine where it can be taken up as immunogenic antigens and presented to lymphocytes.""}"

In some of its earliest conceptualisations (see, for example, Niskanen 1991), soft infrastructure is viewed as the core institutional framework that underpins the operation of an economic, political and/or social system. Overtime, this conceptualisation has evolved to stress the role of soft infrastructure as an enabler of hard infrastructure (i.e. transport, energy and information), with the former setting the frameworks and rules for the latter's establishment, evolution and usage. The salience of soft infrastructure to national infrastructure systems (NISs) has only increased as these systems have morphed into polycentric systems under a mix of state and non-state ownership, but also as shifts in the form and volume of flows within and across NIS has reshaped usage. Initially this chapter will examine the emergent themes between territoriality and links between the soft and hard infrastructure systems. Thereafter the chapter moves on to focus upon two main themes on the soft/hard infrastructure interface namely usage and provision-based issues. The salience of soft infrastructure to the NIS reflects that the ability of hard infrastructure to function to the needs of the state's territorial strategy requires an enabling institutional system comprising a set of rules (both formal and informal) that seek to shape activity over – and development within – the NIS to ensure its adherence to the state's territorial objectives (North 1994). These rules operate as constraints""}"

We studied both female mate choice and male–male competition for mates among C. pecosensis, C. variegatus, and their F1 hybrids to determine what role these behaviours played in the formation of the hybrid swarm. Female C. pecosensis preferred male C. variegatus to conspecific males, C. variegatus females displayed no significant preference when given a choice between purebred males, and neither C. pecosensis nor C. variegatus females discriminated against F1 hybrid males. We found no evidence for female olfactory recognition of mates. Male F1 hybrids and C. variegatus were more aggressive than C. pecosensis males, achieving greater reproductive success under two different experimentally-induced mating systems. Hybrids were superior to C. variegatus when only two males competed (dominance interactions), but the two types were competitively equivalent in a territorial mating system. Our results indicate that active inter- and intra-sexual selection contributed to the accelerated hybridization between these two species. By including the possibility that some aspects of a hybridization and introgression event may be under positive selection, researchers may better understand the dynamics that lead to hybrid zone stability or the spread of introgressed genetic material.""}"

METHODS Four consecutive patients with intracranial tumors in eloquent areas underwent diffusion-weighted and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging studies within 48 hours before surgery. Diffusion-weighted datasets were merged with anatomic data for navigation purposes. The pyramidal tracts were segmented and reconstructed for three-dimensional visualization. The reconstruction results, together with the fused-image dataset, were available during surgery in the environment of a customized neuronavigation system. RESULTS In all four patients, the combination of reconstructed data and fused images was a helpful additional source of information concerning the tumor seat and topographical interaction with the pyramidal tract. In two patients, intraoperative motor cortex stimulation verified the tumor seat with regard to the precentral gyrus. CONCLUSION Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows individual estimation of large fiber tracts applicable as important information in intraoperative neuronavigation and in planning brain tumor resection. A three-dimensional representation of fibers associated with the pyramidal tract during brain tumor surgery is feasible with the presented technique and is a helpful adjunct for the neurosurgeon. The main drawbacks include the length of time required for the segmentation procedure, the lack of direct intraoperative control of the pyramidal tract position, and brain shift. However, mapping of large fiber tracts and its intraoperative use for neuronavigation have the potential to increase the safety of neurosurgical procedures and to reduce surgical morbidity.""}"

Pendleton and fellow Democrat Clement Vallandigham, who opposed the greenbacks when they were initially introduced, took a leading role in demanding currency inflation. The Democratic Party's adoption of inflationary monetary policy forced the Republican Party to defend deflationary monetary policies and the gold standard. This chapter first considers Treasury Department Secretary Hugh McCulloch's decision to withdraw greenbacks from circulation following the end of the Civil War before discussing greenback inflation as a campaign strategy employed by Pendleton in his attempt to become the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination of 1868. It also explores the ramifications of the Democrats' adoption of currency inflation for the development of bureaucratic authority in the Treasury Department.""}"

Thus, construction management can be a key success factor to the small construction projects. Many construction projects are built in Jeju. The middle and large projects have competent management personnels, but the small projects need a person or a company to help to complete the project goals. This research shows two case projects.

The results show that the whistler‐mode turbulence (0.1 f ce ≤ f ≤ 0.75 f ce ) can accelerate substorm injection electrons with several hundreds of keV through wave‐particle gyroresonant interaction and hence may play an important role in the electron acceleration during substorms. The compressional ULF turbulence (2–15 mHz) can accelerate both lower‐energy background electrons (&lt;30 keV) and substorm injection electrons (∼30–300 keV) through the transit‐time damping mechanism. So the compressional ULF turbulence acceleration mechanism is important during both substorms and quiet times. The compressional ULF turbulence accelerates substorm injection electrons more effectively than whistler‐mode turbulence. The combined electron acceleration by whistler‐mode and ULF turbulences is most effective and can cause the number density of the relativistic electrons increase largely within about 8 hours. Substorms can offer both substorm injection electrons and strong turbulences, and therefore large flux enhancement events of relativistic electrons (≥1 MeV) always occur during substorm time. For magnetic storms that are composed of a series of substorms, extremely large flux enhancement events of the relativistic electrons can thus occur.""}"

A questionnaire was posted to Brazilian dental implant specialists, containing open and closed questions about their knowledge and understanding of BQ assessment, and 221 answered the questionnaire. Data were gathered and methods for BQ assessment were grouped using hierarchical cluster analysis. Answers about BQ knowledge and understanding were categorized into quantity of cortical and marrow bone (n = 72), density (n = 55), type of bone (n = 35), bone height (n = 30), bone thickness (n = 27), primary stability (n = 24) and other less common categories. BQ assessment was judged relevant to be considered a selection criterion for implant treatment. Overall frequency analysis showed that methods were roughly divided into usual (n > 170) and unusual methods (n < 9). Cluster analysis grouped BQ assessment methods into four clusters: unusual methods (DEXA, resonance frequency, Periotest and occlusal radiography), perioperative methods (peak insertion torque and tactile perception), sectional imaging (computed tomography) and plain films (periapical and panoramic radiographs). No consensus on BQ understanding or the clinical application of methods to assess BQ was found in this survey.

Almost all mechanical models for the dynamic behaviour used so far, assume simple support boundary conditions. In reality, in the case of two-dimensional webs immersed in a viscous fluid, a low pressure zone will be present under the web near the point where the web detaches from the rotating drum. Other effects such as adhesion forces may also contribute. Thus, as can often also be seen already by naked-eye examination, the web does not detach tangentially from the drum. In this paper a mechanical model for small amplitude vibrations of a traveling web with small sag is developed, which takes into account the effect of the above described upstream boundary condition. The web is modeled as a one-dimensional heavy string without bending stiffness. The assumption of quasi-static stretching is made, i.e. infinitely high wave speed is assumed for longitudinal waves.""}"

In particular, the influence of manganese ferrite loading and gas filling on pick-off ortho -positronium ( o -Ps) annihilation processes in the investigated samples was a point of interest. Disappearance of the longest-lived o -Ps component with τ 5 present in the PAL spectrum of initial MCM-41 mesoporous material in the PAL spectra of MnFe 2 O 4 -impregnated MCM-41 measured in vacuum is a result of either a strong chemical o -Ps quenching or the Ps inhibition effects. The intensity I 4 of the medium-lived component initially increases, reaching a maximum value for the sample with minimum manganese ferrite content, and then decreases monotonically. Analogous dependence for the intensity I 3 of the shortest-lived component shows a maximum at higher MnFe 2 O 4 content. Filling of open pores present in the studied nanocomposites by N 2 or O 2 at ambient pressure causes partial reappearance of the τ 4 and τ 5 components, except a sample with maximum ferrite content. The lifetimes of these components measured in O 2 are shortened in comparison to that observed in N 2 because of paramagnetic quenching. Anti-inhibition and anti-quenching effects of atmospheric gases observed in the MnFe 2 O 4 /MCM-41 samples are a result of neutralization of some surface active centers acting as inhibitors and weakening of pick-off annihilation mechanism, respectively.""}"

The author has tried to identify all the studies in the field during the specified period and present them in chronological order. Interest in the development of Dutch foreign policy became particularly evident after the Belgian revolution of 1830, while the authors of numerous polemical writings were mainly politicians, statesmen representing the liberals and conservative clergymen (J.R. Thorbecke, G. Groen van Prinsterer), and law professors. In the middle of the century, as the international situation grew increasingly tense, political journalism gradually gave way to the first scholarly studies of foreign policy. A further step that gave impetus to historians&amp;apos; work on the subject was the work of the jurist G.W. Vreede, author, in addition to a large number of serious works on Dutch foreign policy, of a truly groundbreaking work on the history of the country&amp;apos;s diplomacy since the end of the sixteenth century. In the early decades of the formation of the Dutch school of history only isolated dissertations on the subject of foreign policy appeared, namely works by the jurist J.C. de Jonge and the accomplished professional historians H.T. Colenbrander, N. Japikse and A.J. D&amp;apos;Ailly. They were written under the supervision of the country&amp;apos;s leading historians, R.J. Fruin and P.J. Block at Leiden University and H.K. Rogge at the University of Amsterdam. At the beginning of the twentieth century, foreign policy became the subject of research by A. Kalshofen, S.V.A. Drossars, dissertators in the Department of National History at Leiden University. The author’s aim is to draw the attention of Russian scholars to the history of small states, the history of the Netherlands in particular, and its relevance stems from the possibility of working with many of the Dutch library collections, which have already been digitised in recent years. This allows one to embark on a more detailed study of the problems of foreign policy of the Netherlands in the Modern and Contemporary era and to introduce a set of new sources and monographs into the academic circuit.""}"

Understanding the role that microbiome play in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) and its progression to metastatic disease remains largely underexplored. We hypothesize that specific bacterial biofilms in the prostate govern the behavior of PCa in regards to indolent or progressive disease in relationship to inflammatory immune markers. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. Eleven subjects had a Gleason score (GS) of 6 or 3+4, six subjects had a GS of 4+3, and eight subjects had a GS of ≥8. DNA was extracted from tissue blocks and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was completed to identify the bacterial communities within the tissue. Additionally, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to identify biofilms within the tissue. RESULTS: A total of 512 bacterial signatures were detected across the 25 subjects. Most of the genera detected originating from within the gut. Bacterial diversity narrowed in relationship to higher grade disease. Three hundred eighty-one detections occur in the 6 or 3+4 GS group, seventy-one detections in the 4+3 group, and sixty detections in the ≥8 group. Of the bacteria detected, 39 distinct bacterial genera were identified with 28 exhibiting significant differences in prevalence between the three GS groups. Four bacterial species, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium longum displayed loss of expression with statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05) between the 6 or 3+4 GS group and the 4+3 group. Additionally, bacterial biofilms were discovered within the prostate tissue by using FISH and confocal microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial species in prostate specimens showed reduced microbial diversity in higher GS groups, suggesting a possible pathophysiological correlation between the composition of the biofilm and PCa aggressiveness. Additionally, the discovery of bacterial biofilms within the PCa tissue identifies a potential source of inflammation. The identification of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium species differences between the GS 3+4 and 4+3 groups provides a potential bacterial biomarker for PCa and altering the microbiome may be indicated for reducing the chance of progression.

Every project is unique, as all organisms are different and variety of different data types and tools exist. There are no golden standards, and the technology is rapidly advancing with new sequence technologies becoming available at a quick pace. Experience in genome assembly and annotation exists in Europe but it varies between the ELIXIR Nodes, with some already having built up stable infrastructures and others just starting out. However, the need exists in all countries, not least because new sequencing technologies have made genome assembly and annotation more affordable and more feasible even over this past year. Consequently, one of the major goals of EXCELERATE task 10.3 is to build the capacity in genome assembly and annotation where it currently is insufficiently developed.

This study suggests two potential psychological pathways linking physical activity and social media dependence in adolescence, with depression potentially serving as a mediating factor and difficulty describing feelings acting as a moderating factor. A self-reported survey was conducted with 3,247 Chinese adolescents, including measures of physical activity, social media dependence, depression, and difficulty describing feelings. Descriptive statistics and correlation analyses were performed on these variables, and a mediation-moderation model was developed. Physical activity showed a significant negative correlation with social media dependence, depression, and difficulty describing feelings. Additionally, depression was positively correlated with both social media dependence and difficulty describing feelings, and difficulty describing feelings was positively correlated with social media dependence. Furthermore, difficulty describing feelings moderated the relationship between depression and social media dependence in adolescence. This study provides further insights into the psychological mechanisms underlying the relationship between physical activity and social media dependence in adolescence. Depression serves as a mediating factor, while difficulty describing feelings acts as a moderating factor in the relationship between depression and social media dependence. These findings enhance our understanding of the role of depression and difficulty describing feelings in the relationship between physical activity and social media dependence, offering valuable implications for more comprehensive and targeted interventions aimed at reducing social media dependence among adolescents.""}"

This conclusion is based on ABB`s experience level, as well as the multi-step potential of the combined cycle process to improve in many component without introducing radical changes that might increase costs and lower RAM. The technical approach to achieve 60% or better thermal efficiency will include increased turbine inlet temperatures, compressor intercooling, as well a improvements in material, turbine cooling technology and the steam turbine.

One of the drawbacks presented by the porous electrodes is the accumulation of water in their structure, which implies a hindrance for the reactive gas transport to reach the catalytic reactive sites. In this paper, a mathematical model of a porous electrode, assuming single pores with uniform distribution, is introduced to determine the influence of water accumulation in the electrode on the fuel cell performance under different operating conditions.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) separates them to one food group «Roots and Tubers». Currently, the most important among them are potatoes, cassava, sweet potatoes, yam. They are grown both to meet the needs of the population for food and some branches of food industry for the necessary raw materials and for use as feed for farm animals. Within the framework of this work, the change in the global physical parameters of potato production and similar starch-containing tuber-and-root crops in the world as a whole and in individual countries was investigated for the period 1961–2019. Among these plants, potatoes are the most important. Although this agricultural crop is native to the southern hemisphere of the Earth, in its time it received its maximum distribution in the northern hemisphere. However, in recent decades, potatoes in the global food balance have been gradually decreasing their positions, yielding a significant part to cassava. In 1961, potatoes occupied 59.42% of the starch-containing tuber-and-root crops included in «Roots and Tubers», and in 2019 it already accounted for only 43.02%. At the same time, cassava has strengthened its position from 15.65% to 35.26%. If this trend continues in future, that is quite possible, taking into account the prospects of population growth in those countries of the world where cassava is grown, then this plant can intercept the «palm tree» in the «Roots and Tubers» food group. The article reflects the transformation of the importance of individual states in the global ranking of countries – the main producers of potatoes and similar starch-containing tuber-and-root crops for the period 1961–2019 and it revealed a significant strengthening of the position of some developing countries, in particular Nigeria and India, and a decrease in the importance of Poland, Germany, as well as a number of states that emerged after the collapse of the USSR.""}"

The use of the crystal, however, has been hampered by the unavailability of antireflective (AR) coatings with high laser damage resistance. In this work, a “point contact” dip-coating method is developed to prepare sol–gel SiO2 AR coatings on small-size LBO crystals. Using this approach, we obtain a homogenous coating surface on an 8 mm×8 mm×3 mm LBO crystal. The stress measurements show that the stresses in sol–gel SiO2 coatings vary with the time of natural drying, which is beyond our expectation. The anisotropic Young’s modulus of the LBO crystal and the different evolution tendency of the stress in the different SiO2 coating layers are found to be responsible for the crack of the double-layer AR coatings on anisotropic LBO crystal. Meanwhile, the resulting coatings on LBO crystal achieve a LIDT of over 15 J/cm2 (532 nm, 3ns) and the coated LBO is expected to have a transmittance of over 99% at 800 nm.""}"

These properties of diamond are related to its unique lattice and optically active defect centers. In this paper, the dependence of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center on measurement temperature is studied by using the low-temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy in a temperature range of 80–200 K. The results show that with the increase of the measurement temperature, the zero phonon lines of NV defects are red-shifted, its intensity decreases and its full width at half maximum increases. These results are attributed to the synergetic process of the lattice expansion and quadratic electron-phonon coupling. The NV&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt; and NV&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; centers have similar values in the quenching activation energy and the thermal softening coefficient, resulting from their similar structures.

Therefore, much attention is paid to improving the efficiency of the last stages of gas turbines as well as the distribution of flow parameters. Since the long blades of the last stages of multistage high-power gas turbines could fall into the resonance frequency range in the course of operation, which results in the destruction of the blades, damping wires or damping bolts are used for turning out of resonance frequencies. However, these damping elements cause additional energy losses leading to a reduction in the efficiency of the stage. To minimize these losses, dampening shrouds are used instead of wires and bolts at the periphery of the working blades. However, because of the strength problems, designers have to use, instead of the most efficient full shrouds, partial shrouds that do not provide for significantly reducing the losses in the tip clearance between the blade and the turbine housing. In this paper, a computational study is performed concerning an effect that the design of the shroud of the turbine-working blade exerted on the flow structure in the vicinity of the shroud and on the efficiency of the stage as a whole. The analysis of the flow structure has shown that a significant part of the losses under using the shrouds is associated with the formation of vortex zones in the cavities on the turbine housing before the shrouds, between the ribs of the shrouds, and in the cavities at the outlet behind the shrouds. All the investigated variants of a partial shrouding are inferior in efficiency to the stages with shrouds that completely cover the tip section of the working blade. The stage with a unshrouded working blade was most efficient at the values of the relative tip clearance less than 0.9%.""}"

A slew rate of 1 V/ mu s with a 10000 pF load capacitance has been achieved, while requiring a quiescent power dissipation of less than 1.5 mW.< <ETX xmlns:mml=\""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"" xmlns:xlink=\""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"">&gt;</ETX>""}"

Potential applicationsThis paragraph proposes an overview of the possible applications of emerging technologies for data sensing, gathering and smart data elaboration with a special focus to the healthcare domain.We partition applications into four groups, even though some overlapping between such groups exist. Knowledge sharing, availability and integrationManagement and delivery of healthcare is critically dependent on access to data.Such data are normally provided by several heterogeneous sources, such as physiological sensors, imaging technology or even handwriting and often spans different organisations.Moreover they are generally stored by using different formats and terminologies, such as electronic health records, clinical databases, or free-text reports.If such a rich collection of health and community data could be linked together, we would improve enormously our capability of finding answers to health and social questions and of tackling complex diseases (Walker, 2005).Unfortunately, sharing such a complex aggregate of information and deriving useful knowledge from it is currently very difficult.A very promising answer to this need is provided by the enabling technologies for smart data collection and management which are named \"" ontologies\"" [Section 3.4].Ontologies define a formal semantically rich machine-readable specification of concepts and relationships which is unique and sharable among dispersed consumers.They provide coherent representations of biomedical reality thus enabling wide-area multi-organizational sharing of data by supporting publishing, retrieving and analysis of data in large-scale, diverse and distributed information systems.Moreover, when integrated with other enabling technologies (such as those listed in Section 3.3 and 3.5) ontologies allow the identification of the correct information to be forwarded to health care professional depending on available information about context, such as time, place, patient current state, physiological data, and so on. Independent livingThe combination of sensors, RFID, wireless protocols and software solutions, is going to enhance aging population and impaired people capability of conducting a possibly autonomous independent living.Indeed, pervasive and context-aware applications are more and more recognized as promising solutions for providing continuous care services, while improving quality of life of people suffering from chronic conditions.""}"

Eine Identifikation der genetischen Ursache einer Erkrankung ist jedoch essenziell, um zusatzliche invasive Tests vermeiden, adaquate Therapiemasnahmen in die Wege leiten, akkurate Prognosen stellen und eine entsprechende genetische Beratung anbieten zu konnen. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-basierte Techniken wie die Whole Exome Sequenzierung (WES) haben die humangenetische Forschung und Diagnostik in den letzten Jahren revolutioniert. Die WES ermoglicht die Sequenzierung der Exons aller proteincodierenden Gene von mehreren Individuen gleichzeitig und stellt ein hilfreiches Werkzeug bei der Suche nach neuen kranheitsrelevanten Genen im Menschen dar.\r\nDie vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich mit der Aufklarung genetischer Ursachen verschiedenster Erkrankungen in konsanguinen Familien aus dem nahen und mittleren Osten mittels WES. Insgesamt wurden 43 Patienten mit unterschiedlichen Krankheitsbildern untersucht, darunter viele mit Skelettdysplasien oder Neuropathien. In 22 Fallen (51%) konnte die entsprechende krankheitsverursachende Mutation ausfindig gemacht werden. In 21% der aufgeklarten Falle wurden Sequenzvarianten detektiert, die in der Literatur bereits als pathogen beschrieben wurden, wahrend 63% bisher noch unbekannte Mutationen in bereits als krankheitsrelevant beschriebenen Genen darstellten. Zudem konnten im Rahmen dieser Arbeit drei neue, fur den Menschen krankheitsrelevante Gene identifiziert werden, solute carrier family 10 member 7 (SLC10A7), T-box 4 (TBX4) und MIA SH3 domain ER export factor 3 (MIA3). SLC10A7 codiert fur einen Transporter aus der Familie der solute carrier, der in der Plasmamembran verankert ist. In dieser Arbeit geleistete Analyseergebnisse konnten zu der Erstbeschreibung von homozygoten pathogenen SLC10A7-Mutationen als Ursache fur eine Skelettdysplasie mit Amelogenesis imperfecta beitragen. Bei TBX4 handelt es sich um einen hochkonservierten Transkriptionsfaktor, der wahrend der embryonalen Entwicklung an der Ausbildung der unteren Extremitaten beteiligt ist. Homozygote pathogene TBX4-Mutationen wurden im Kontext dieser Arbeit erstmalig mit einer posterioren Amelie mit Becken- und Lungenhypoplasie in Verbindung gebracht. MIA3 ist ein Transmembranprotein des endoplasmatischen Retikulums, das eine essenzielle Rolle bei der Proteinsekretion spielt. Die hier vorgestellten Patienten mit homozygoten pathogenen MIA3-Mutationen zeigen eine komplexe syndromale Erkrankung, die sich hauptsachlich in einer Kollagenopathie, Diabetes mellitus und milder mentaler Retardierung manifestiert und ein neues Krankheitsbild darstellt.\r\n\tDie im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erzielten Ergebnisse erweitern somit zum einen das Mutationsspektrum verschiedener bekannter Krankheitsbilder und offenbaren zum anderen neue krankheitsrelevante Gene im Menschen.""}"

We proposed a model for channel activation in which Ca 2+ binding to calmodulin induces conformational rearrangements in calmodulin and the α subunits that result in channel gating. We now report fluorescence measurements that indicate conformational changes in the α subunit after calmodulin binding and Ca 2+ binding to the α subunit–calmodulin complex. Two-hybrid experiments showed that the Ca 2+ -independent interaction of calmodulin with the α subunits requires only the C-terminal domain of calmodulin and is mediated by two noncontiguous subregions; the ability of the E-F hands to bind Ca 2+ is not required. Although SK α subunits lack a consensus calmodulin-binding motif, mutagenesis experiments identified two positively charged residues required for Ca 2+ -independent interactions with calmodulin. Electrophysiological recordings of SK2 channels in membrane patches from oocytes coexpressing mutant calmodulins revealed that channel gating is mediated by Ca 2+ binding to the first and second E-F hand motifs in the N-terminal domain of calmodulin. Taken together, the results support a calmodulin- and Ca 2+ -calmodulin-dependent conformational change in the channel α subunits, in which different domains of calmodulin are responsible for Ca 2+ -dependent and Ca 2+ -independent interactions. In addition, calmodulin is associated with each α subunit and must bind at least one Ca 2+ ion for channel gating. Based on these results, a state model for Ca 2+ gating was developed that simulates alterations in SK channel Ca 2+ sensitivity and cooperativity associated with mutations in CaM.""}"

Events and new social movements of recent years seem to hail the collapse of the project of liberal democracy, though it is hard to see what will replace it. Among the conceptual and analytic tools bequeathed by Marx are those necessary to better understand and anticipate the direction of this key historical moment – from Donald Trump, Brexit and the so-called ‘culture wars’ to the horizon of liberal democracy itself. In this reflection, I suggest some ways in which Marx’s early thoughts on the liberal state and civil society can and should help us to better understand and explain our present predicament. To say that the Young Marx can help us today with what he called ‘the ruthless critique of everything existing’ is not to say that he can do so alone. It is precisely the issues overlooked or ‘fudged’ by Marx and Marxism – gender, sexuality, and race/racism for example – that now sit at the centre of our ‘culture wars’, alongside but never reducible to the contradictions and crises of capitalism. I conclude that it is only with the help of other writers of the 20th and 21st centuries, from Antonio Gramsci to Frantz Fanon and bell hooks, that we can usefully mobilise the Young Marx today, to critique the world as we find it and especially – the very ‘point’ of theory according to Marx – to change it.""}"

This analysis of girls' narratives about fighting and violence in their daily schooled lives validates girls' stories about fighting within a larger context of structural and interpersonal violence, describes the kind of power Jordan argues is necessary to address both adults' complicity in violence (against youth) and the systemic nature of violence, and demonstrates how and why the performance of homegirls' poetry enables girls in SOLHOT to practice freedom as Bambara instructed. In response to girls' stories, a performance of listening, courage, and interdependence as exemplified by SOLHOT homegirls is advocated as a visionary solution to the popular–policy problem so often constructed as girlfighting, mean girls, and/or bullying.""}"

During starvation small amounts of intracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase and β-glucosidase activities were also detected. Very low levels of -glucanase activity remained bound to mycelium and some activity was found loosely attached to the cells and/or to water-soluble 1,3-β-1,6-β-glucan adhering to the cell walls. During active growth intracellular 1,3-β-glucanase and mycelium-bound 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were detected in small or trace amounts. During hyphal growth very low levels of 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were also found to be weakly associated with the cells and/or with water-soluble -glucan covering the hyphae. Cycloheximide inhibited the increase in intra- and extracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase and -glucosidase activities. This indicated that de novo protein synthesis was involved in the intra- and extracellular appearance of these three enzyme activities in derepressed cells. The formation of the extracellular 1,3-β-glucanase, 1,6-β-glucanase and -glucosidase activities was regulated by catabolite repression. 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were uncompetitively inhibited and -glucosidase activity noncompetitively inhibited by glucose and glucono-δ-lactone. Optimum pH and temperature values as well as thermal stabilities of the three extracellular enzyme activities were determined. Almost all of the -glucosidase activity but only one-third of the extracellular 1,3-β- and 1,6-β-glucanase activities were found to bind to Con A-Sepharose. Under conditions of carbon limitation almost 90% of the extracellular 1,3-β-/1,6-β-glucan excreted during fungal growth was degraded by the extracellular -glucanases.""}"

Hypertension does not only occur in adults but in adolescents. The prevalence of Indonesian hypertension is relatively high at 34.1%. Hypertension if not treated immediately can cause death. This study aimed to analyze risk factors of hypertension in high school students. Subjects and Method: This was a cross sectional study conducted in Bantul, Yogyakarta, from April to May 2019. A sample of 200 adolescents aged 15-19 years was selected by probability sampling. The dependent variable was hypertension. The independent variables were gender, genetic history, obesity, dietary pattern, sleep duration, stress, and money pocket. The data on hypertension were collected using sphygmomanometer. BMI was measured by microtoise and weight scale. Data on stress were measured by perceived stress scale (PSS). The other variables were collected by questionnaire. The data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression. Results : The risk of hypertension increased with male gender (b= 1.87; 95% CI= 0.38 to 3.36; p= 0.014), genetic history (b= 1.93; 95% CI= 0.48 to 3.39; p= 0.009), obesity (b= 2.15; 95% CI= 0.76 to 3.55; p= 0.002), poor dietary pattern (b= 1.54 CI 95% = 0.97 to 2.99; p= 0.036), sleep duration <8 hours/day (b= 2.28; 95% CI= 0.63 to 3.93; p= 0.007), high stress (b= 3.52; 95% CI= 1.64 to 5.39; p<0.001), and high money pocket (b= 2.00; 95% CI= 0.45 to 3.56; p= 0.011). School had contextual effect on hypertension with ICC= 22.47%. Conclusions: The risk of hypertension increased with male gender, genetic history, obesity, poor dietary pattern, sleep duration <8 hours/day, high stress, and high money pocket.

In the context of model-based clustering, we introduce an innovative approach for clustering grouped data using linear mixed models with discrete random effects and exponential family responses (e.g. Poisson or Bernoulli). Our method uncovers the latent clustering structure, net of fixed effects, by assuming that random effects follow a discrete distribution with an a priori unknown number of support points. We refine this process within a modified Expectation–Maximization algorithm, collapsing support points of the discrete distribution with overlapping estimated confidence intervals or regions, derived from the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators. This approach offers a transparent interpretation of the latent structure, distinct from existing tools for discrete random effects, which often rely on discretionary tuning parameters or predetermined cluster counts. Through simulation studies, we compare our approach with traditional parametric methods and state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness. We apply our model on real-world data from the Programme for International Student Assessment, aiming to classify countries based on their impact on low-achieving student rates in schools. Our methodology provides valuable insights for effective policy formulation.""}"

Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare gait performance during both MT and NMT locomotion to OG. Design : Crossover study. Setting : A university research laboratory. Patients : A total of 20 healthy adults (10 women) participated in the study. Intervention : Each participant performed self-selected walking and running OG, and on both an MT and NMT. Main Outcome Measure : Shoulder, trunk, and lower-extremity kinematics were analyzed for each treadmill condition and compared to OG. Results : The analyses demonstrated that there were no differences between MT and OG gait kinematics during either walking or running. However, NMT gait showed increased hip, knee, and ankle flexions in late swing and early stance compared to OG during both walking and running. For example, during walking, the NMT elicited hip-, knee-, and ankle-flexion/extension angles of 34.7°, 8.0°, and 3.6° at foot strike compared to 24.8°, −3.1°, and −5.8° in the OG condition ( P &lt; .05). There was also a significant reduction in trunk-flexion/extension range of motion during running compared to OG (7.7° in NMT vs 9.8° in OG). Conclusions : These differences may have implications for both training and rehabilitation on an NMT. Future studies should consider the influence of NMT familiarization on gait performance and should emphasize the assessment of neuromuscular performance.""}"

Der erste thematische Schwerpunkt der Arbeit widmet sich der Verbesserung der Stabilität von kationensensitiven Rezeptorschichten. Werden diese durch einfache Einkapselung von Indikatoren hergestellt, so wird die Stabilität der Schicht bedingt durch das Auswaschen des Farbstoffes auf etwa einen Tag begrenzt. Zur Unterdrückung dieses Farbstoffaustrages wurde eine neue Immobilisierungsmethode entwickelt und erprobt, die in der kovalenten Anbindung von Fluoreszenzindikatoren an das wasserlösliche Polysaccharid Dextran (70.000 g/mol) und der anschließenden Einkapselung der makromolekular gebundenen Indikatormoleküle in hydrophilen Matrices besteht. Als Matrices wurden anorganische Silikagele, die nach dem Sol-Gel-Verfahren hergestellt wurden, und das organische Hydrogel Polyhydroxyethylmethacrylat (PolyHEMA) eingesetzt. Die vorgestellte Immobilisierungsmethode weist gegenüber der direkten kovalenten Anbindung des Indikators an die Matrix eine deutlich erhöhte Flexibilität auf, was beispielhaft an drei Analyt-Rezeptor-Paaren dargestellt wird. Zur Herstellung von Quecksilber-sensitiven Schichten wurden zunächst Porphyrin-Dextrane synthetisiert und mittels spektroskopischer Methoden sowie durch Elektrophorese charakterisiert. Porphyrin-Dextran-dotierte, mesoporöse Silikagel- Schichten zeigten nach 40tägiger Lagerung in Meßpuffer noch 92% der anfänglichen Fluoreszenzintensität. Auf der Basis von Fluorescein-Dextran wurden pH-sensitive Silikagel- und PolyHEMA-Schichten hergestellt. Letztere zeigten einen Meßbereich von pH 5 bis 8 und Ansprechzeiten von 5 Sekunden/pH. Nach 18tägiger Lagerung in Meßpuffer zeigten die Sensoren noch über 95% der ursprünglichen Fluoreszenzintensitäten. Durch Coimmobilisierung von Calcium Green-Dextran und Texas Red-Dextran wurde ein Calcium-sensitiver Sensor mit interner Referenz hergestellt. Der Meßbereich des Sensors liegt zwischen 5 10-8 und 10-5 mol/l Ca(II) bei Ansprechzeiten von 5 Sekunden bis zum Erreichen des Sättigungswertes. Der Sensor erwies sich als sehr selektiv gegenüber Interferenzen von Na(I), K(I) und Mg(II). Durch die interne Referenzierung des Meßsignals läßt sich die Reproduzierbarkeit der Sensorsignale entscheidend verbessern. Als zweiter Schwerpunkt der Arbeit wurde in mehreren Schritten die Miniaturisierung der Calciumsensoren mit interner Referenz vorgenommen. Unter Verwendung von optischer Fasertechnik wurden Mikrosensoren mit Durchmessern von 600 bzw. 50 µm entwickelt. Basierend auf verjüngten Faserspitzen (Taper) mit Durchmessern von etwa 300 nm wurden die derzeit kleinsten faseroptischen Calciumsensoren (Nanosensoren) erhalten. Aufgrund der verbesserten Stabilität und der extremen Miniaturisierung der vorgestellten optischen Sensoren lassen sich in Zukunft neue analytische Aufgabenstellungen (z.B. Messung in biologischen Zellen) mit einer Ortsauflösung im Nanometerbereich bearbeiten.""}"

Abstract An expanded study is presented to determine whether the use of online learning objects enhances mastery of key concepts in mechanical engineering. Each course in the department has a defined set of required competencies that each student must satisfy in order to receive a passing grade in the course. Multiple opportunities are provided for satisfying each course competency during the semester, including the final examination. Three introductory mechanical engineering courses, dynamics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamics were selected for this study. After introducing the concept underlying the given competency in class, students were assigned a homework set that required the use of an online learning object related to the competency. Mastery of the concept was tested using a competency quiz administered during the next class meeting and multiple-choice problems on the final examination. The performance of students who had used the online learning objects was compared to that of students in previous semesters who had covered the same material and had been assigned similar homework in the traditional manner of chalkboard and written assignments. Differences in the performances of the two groups will be discussed along with a learning styles assessment conducted for the students in both classes. Also, two online learning objects were selected to assist students for two different concepts in two courses to assess whether the instructors choice of the learning objects was an important factor in helping students master course competencies. Introduction It has been well established in the literature1-3 that engineering students are typically visual rather than verbal learners. Nonetheless, engineering instructors still rely heavily on the traditional lectures to teach students. While lectures are often accompanied by sketches on the chalkboard or pictures projected onto a screen, the primary instructional tool is still verbal in nature. All too often the instructional approach is still “instructor-centered” rather than “student-centered.” Accompanying the dramatic rise in the use of the internet in the past ten years has been the development and collection of online learning materials. A learning object is any entity, be it digital or non-digital that may be used for education and/or training4. With regard to online learning, these objects can be comprised of Web pages, portable documents, databases, animations, applets, and movies. Online learning objects are increasingly being used to supplement traditional lectures and are becoming an important foundation to the delivery of online courses. Cost-effective and efficient delivery of online learning tools has become a focus in recent years. Several organizations, activities, and consortia, such as Ariadne5, MERLOT6,""}"

These two forces are separate entities but act together on the shared symbolic and physical space of Singaporean society to bring about the central tension of socio-cultural identity fragmentation, it is the aim of this thesis to both understand and explore this fragmentation before possibly suggesting a way the arts can resist and heal this fragmentation.""}"

Messages transmitted through a noisy channel are susceptible to modification in their content, due to the action of the noise of the channel. Claude E. Shannon, in his seminal paper of 1948 \""A Mathematical Theory of Communication\"", introduces the bit as a unit of measure of information, and he lays down the theoretical foundations needed to understand the problem of sending bits reliably through a noisy channel. The distortion measure, which he used to quantify reliability, is the error probability. In his paper, Shannon shows that any channel is characterized by a number that he calls capacity: It represents the highest transmission rate that can be used to communicate information with, through this same channel, while guaranteeing a negligible error probability. Whereas, even if the messages are sent through a perfect channel, the time they take to reach their destination causes the receiver to acquire a distorted view of the status of the source that generated these messages. For instance, take the case of a monitor interested in the status of a distant process. A sender observes this process and, to keep the monitor up-to-date, sends updates to it. However, if, at any time t, the last received update at the monitor was generated at time u(t), then the information at the receiver reflects the status of the process at time u(t), not at time t. Hence, the monitor has a distorted version of reality. In fact, it has an obsolete version with an age of t-u(t). The concept of age as a distortion measure in communication systems was first used in 2011 by Kaul et al., in order to assess the performance of a given vehicular network. The aim of the authors was to come up with a transmission scheme that would minimize an age-related metric: the average age. Since then, a growing body of works has used this metric to evaluate the performance of multiple communication systems. The drive behind this interest lies in the importance that status-update applications are gaining in today's life (in vehicular networks, warehouse and environment surveillance, news feed,etc.). In this thesis, we choose age as a distortion measure and derive expressions for the average age and the average peak-age (another age-related metric) for different communication systems. Therefore, we divide this dissertation into two parts: In the first part, we assume that the the updates are transmitted through a noiseless channel that has a random service time. In the second part, we consider a special category of noisy channels, namely the erasure channel. In the first part of this thesis, in order to compute the age-related metrics, we employ queue-theoretic concepts. We study and compare the performance of various transmission schemes under different settings.We show that the optimal transmission scheme when the monitor is interested in a single source loses its optimality when another source of higher priority shares the system. In the second part of this thesis, we introduce, in our age calculations, the distortion caused by the erasure channel on the transmitted updates. In order to combat the erasures of the channel, we first consider two flavors of the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). Finally, we focus on the optimal average age that could be achieved over an erasure channel.""}"

Recently conducted international studies suggest a prevalence rate close to 2% for GD, highlighting the need for effective treatments for this patient population. Internationally there are very few studies investigating effective treatments for this condition. In this pilot study, we wanted to test a newly developed method, the Swedish GOT-TO-GO manual; a 15-week cognitive behavioral therapy treatment for GD. Method: This study utilized a single group design with pretest, post-test and a 3 and 6 month follow up with measures of severity of GD and mood. Patients (n=20) were treatment-seeking adults with GD (mean age 27). Results: Results show a statistically significant decrease in symptoms of GD after treatment. Hours of gaming per week also decreased concomitant with a 100 % increase in non-gaming leisure hours. The decrease in symptoms of GD was sustained at follow up 6 months after treatment. Correspondingly we saw a decrease in depression that was sustained 6 months after treatment. The drop-out rate was 20% and we were able to recruit 20 patients during the study period. Conclusion: As GD is a new diagnostic concept more research is needed to arrive at evidence-based conclusions on effective treatments. Considering the promising results in this small pilot study with large behavioral changes and reduced symptoms of GD, upheld at least 6 months after treatment, a larger randomized controlled study is warranted and considered to be feasible based on recruitment and drop-out rates.

Revelations of the last three great controversies at the Louvre Over the 19th and 20th centuries, the Louvre faced public criticism over restorations on three occasions : in the 1850s, after several restorations performed at the behest of the curator of paintings Frédéric Villot ; in 1935 when Titus, or Portrait of a young man, then attributed to Rembrandt, was cleaned ; and more recently in 1989-1992 during the spectacular cleaning of the Marriage at Cana by Veronese. Regardless of their origins and outcomes, such controversies force us to conceive of conservation as a social world involving not only conservators and curators, but also museum users more generally, and connoisseurs and artists in particular. Comparing statements made by various protagonists implicated in these three controversies, the present paper shows how freshly cleaned paintings put the public to the test. Four sections explain the context in which people became aware of the restored works, what kind of preferences characterized those who challenged the restorations, what catalyzed the outburst of the controversy, and finally how the debates evolved over time due to the increased use of scientific tools and arguments. The conclusion questions the role of museum users in the conservation process.""}"

Today, about ten large data sets, each with thousands of interacting pairs, coarsely sample the interactions in fly, human, worm, and yeast. Another about 55,000 pairs of interacting proteins have been identified by more careful, detailed biochemical experiments. Most interactions are experimentally observed in prokaryotes and simple eukaryotes; very few interactions are observed in higher eukaryotes such as mammals. It is commonly assumed that pathways in mammals can be inferred through homology to model organisms, e.g. the experimental observation that two yeast proteins interact is transferred to infer that the two corresponding proteins in human also interact. Two pairs for which the interaction is conserved are often described as interologs. The goal of this investigation was a large-scale comprehensive analysis of such inferences, i.e. of the evolutionary conservation of interologs. Here, we introduced a novel score for measuring the overlap between protein-protein interaction data sets. This measure appeared to reflect the overall quality of the data and was the basis for our two surprising results from our large-scale analysis. Firstly, homology-based inferences of physical protein-protein interactions appeared far less successful than expected. In fact, such inferences were accurate only for extremely high levels of sequence similarity. Secondly, and most surprisingly, the identification of interacting partners through sequence similarity was significantly more reliable for protein pairs within the same organism than for pairs between species. Our analysis underlined that the discrepancies between different datasets are large, even when using the same type of experiment on the same organism. This reality considerably constrains the power of homology-based transfer of interactions. In particular, the experimental probing of interactions in distant model organisms has to be undertaken with some caution. More comprehensive images of protein-protein networks will require the combination of many high-throughput methods, including in silico inferences and predictions. http://www.rostlab.org/results/2006/ppi_homology/""}"

ISBN 978-0-545-70955-2 $17.99 Reviewed from galleys M Gr. 9-12 Fifteen-year-old Tretch is in love with his best friend, Matt, even though Matt is clearly straight. Since Matt’s fathers are gay, Tretch knows that coming out won’t end the friendship, but he still doesn’t want to risk it. Instead, he goes along with whatever Matt wants to do, from tagging along on a date with a girl Matt likes, to double-dating with a girl who is obviously interested in Tretch. Meanwhile, he fantasizes, and worries, and dances. Matt is certainly lovable, if a bit hard to picture as a character; his dialogue settles somewhere between emotionally intense and cornball, and his frequent physically affectionate gestures with Tretch make it [End Page 63] easy to see why Tretch might be attracted to him. However, the plotting falls short of coherent. Random incidents follow one another, punctuated by stilted dialogue and choppy scenes that neither flow into one another nor connect thematically. For instance, after thinking about his great-uncle, a Vietnam vet who took his own life, Tretch goes out to stargaze on a frozen lake in the middle of the night and falls in, only to be rescued by his father, who happened to follow him. Later, the boys are called on to help Tretch’s squeamish farmer grandfather deliver a breech calf in the middle of the night, Tretch makes up with a homophobic bully by yelling at him for smoking, and he then cuts a fine rug at a New Year’s Eve dance after coming out to his date. It’s hard to tell whether the bumpy dialogue is because the characters are not realistic or because they are too realistic for art, but ultimately this requires readers with a high tolerance for literary and character awkwardness.

The habitats preferred by this species are natural, moist and deciduous forests with old trees and water streams. The majority of known locations of this species come from highlands, foothills and mountainous regions while practically not occurring in the lower elevations. They come mainly from cave areas, where bats were caught during autumn swarming, while records in other seasons are much less frequent. Currently, individual sites in Poland also come from lowlands, beyond the range of the mountains and uplands, which indicates a possible wider range of this species. The bats were captured using mist-nests in the Silesian Lowlands for three consecutive years (2013–2015). The localities were placed in various forest environments, ranging in elevation from 100 to 260 m a.s.l. Bats were initially identified based on morphological features, then the correctness of identification was confirmed by molecular methods. Two females and five males of Myotis alcathoe were captured into four new locations from the lowlands of Poland: Przemków, Głębowice, Chodlewo, and Dalkowskie Jary (Silesian Lowland). Old trees and a small watercourse were important elements in all these locations. Currently, these findings are the northernmost locations of the species in Poland and one of the northernmost locations in Central Europe. The latest findings of the species are located about 50 km to the south, but the vast majority of the rest of locations is from the foothills belt. This finding suggests that the species may inhabit regions much further north than previously suggested, and the limiting factor is the presence of old trees in wet environments.""}"

Warner Burke"", ""affiliations"": [""Teachers College, Columbia University New York, New York, USA""], ""is_corresponding"": true}], ""abstract"": ""Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief history and perspective on the influence of McGregor's Theory Y on research about and practice of management and leadership. Although best known for Theory X and Y, Douglas McGregor involved himself in more than theory. He was for a time President of Antioch College, a builder of a strong academic program of management and organizational behavior in the Sloan School of Management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and a pioneer in the origination of organization development. Design/methodology/approach The legacy of Theory Y can be characterized as a set of beliefs that are antecedents to participative and involvement modes of management, that these modes are associated with success backed by considerable evidence, yet are not practiced by the majority of people in management and leadership positions. Moreover, the track record of management and leadership in the USA is not exactly exemplary, for example, at least half of those in management fail, and more than 70 percent of employees surveyed in a variety of contexts state that the main cause of stress for them at work is their boss. Findings With respect to Theory Y, McGregor's intent was to show the relativity of authority, and that participative management was consistent with Y, but these assumptions did not necessarily lead to a specific style of management. Originality/value This apparent paradox of evidence that involvement forms of management pays off yet few practice participation begs the question of why. Among many reasons the following stand out: executives do not trust the evidence at least not for their levels (It is okay for first line supervisors), and besides participative forms of management require a particular set of skills and competence time (too much one suspects), and patience. Many executives do not have the requisite skills nor do they have the patience to take the time that such forms of management and leadership require.""}"

Nanovaccines are a novel formulation comprised of nanomaterials coupled with an immunogenic component to elicit the immune response and provide protection against the desired infectious disease. The nanovaccines with unique physicochemical properties can be more efficient against targeting the desired tissues in the body, aids in prolong circulation to promote antigen-presenting cells to act upon the target antigens. Main content The present review envisages the development of nanovaccines against antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. The use of nanovaccines can exhibit potent antigenicity with prolonged retention and controlled release to induce both cell- and antibody-mediated responses. Nanovaccines usage is still in the early stages and can be next-generation immunisation for prophylactic and therapeutic efficiency. The future development of nanovaccines against multi-drug-resistant pathogens can explore new avenues. Based on these facts, the present review is designed from the previously reported scientific studies and compiled with the fact that nanovaccines can revolutionise vaccine strategies. The articles were extracted from reputed databases like PubMed, Scopus, and ESCI. The size and conjugating chemistry of nanomaterials can be beneficial in developing novel multi-nanovaccine formulations that can target pools of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Conclusion Overall, the nanovaccines can form one of the best effective modes of targeting multi-drug-resistant pathogens. The nanovaccines can stimulate the innate immune response and generate effective immune-therapeutic novel formulation against infectious pathogens. Based on these facts and considerations, the present article makes an alarming call to develop nanovaccines to counter multi-drug resistance.""}"

Thus, data on familial risks are important for genetic studies and for clinical genetic counseling. Design We carried out a nationwide family study on nontoxic and toxic nodular goiters, and Graves' disease in order to search for familial clustering of these diseases at the population level. Methods The Swedish Multigeneration Register on 0–75 year old subjects was linked to the Hospital Discharge Register from years 1987 to 2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for offspring of affected parents and for siblings by comparing to those whose relatives had no hospitalization for thyroid disease. Results The number of hospitalized patients in the offspring generations was 11 659 for nontoxic goiter, 9514 for Graves' disease, and 1728 for toxic nodular goiter. Familial cases accounted for 8.2, 5.2, and 2.1% of all patients respectively. The highest familial risk for offspring of affected parents was noted for Graves' disease (SIR 3.87), followed by toxic nodular goiter (3.37) and nontoxic goiter (3.15). Familial risks were higher for affected siblings: toxic nodular goiter (11.66), Graves' disease (5.51), and nontoxic goiter (5.40). Weaker familial associations were observed between the three diseases. Conclusions To our knowledge this is a first population-based family study on these thyroid diseases. The observed high familial aggregation for defined thyroid diseases cannot be explained by the known genetic basis, calling for further studies into genetic and environmental etiology of thyroid diseases.""}"

Effects of a moderate dose of red wine (≈ 40.98 g of ethanol) on consciousness were examined in a naturalistic study taking place in a wine bar located in one of the most touristic areas of Lisbon, Portugal. One hundred two participants drank in one of three conditions: alone, in dyad, or in groups up to six people. Red wine increased pleasure and arousal, decreased the awareness of time, slowed the subjective passage of time, increased the attentional focus on the present moment, decreased body awareness, slowed thought speed, turned imagination more vivid, and made the environment become more fascinating. Red wine increased insightfulness and originality of thoughts, increased sensations of oneness with the environment, spiritual feelings, all-encompassing love, and profound peace. All changes in consciousness occurred regardless of volunteers drinking alone, in dyad or in group. Men and women did not report different changes in consciousness. Older age correlated with greater increases in pleasure. Younger age correlated with greater increases in fascination with the environment of the wine bar. Drinking wine in a contemporaneous Western environment designed to enhance the pleasurableness of the wine drinking experience may trigger changes in consciousness commonly associated with mystical-type states.

However, as I demonstrate, this hybrid position is inconsistent with the common assumption that the categorical, unlike the dispositional, is non-modal.

Os dados do mercado de trabalho (RAIS-MTE) mostram que existe um diferencial espacial de salários, o qual pode ser explicado pelas distintas composições produtivas e de trabalhadores entre os locais e pelos diferenciais de custo de vida. A disponibilidade crescente de micro dados longitudinais permitiu a inclusão das habilidades não observadas individuais na equação de salários. Os estudos da Economia do Trabalho mostram que as habilidades são responsáveis por uma grande parcela dos diferenciais de salários. No entanto, os estudos nacionais ainda encontram um diferencial significativo, mesmo após o controle dos componentes individuais e do custo de vida, sugerindo a existência de efeitos específicos associados à localização das firmas e dos trabalhadores. A Economia Urbana considera as economias de aglomeração como um determinante salarial relevante nos mercados de trabalhos densos, particularmente a partir dos trabalhos de Glaeser e Maré (1994; 2001). Por sua vez, a maior produtividade das áreas densas pode ser atribuída à concentração de trabalhadores e firmas mais produtivos, o que ficou conhecido nessa literatura como sorting. Os estudos da Economia Urbana controlam somente o sorting dos atributos individuais não observados. Este trabalho contribui com a literatura ao considerar o sorting espacial dos atributos não observados das firmas e dos trabalhadores na determinação dos salários e dos efeitos de aglomeração. O estudo utiliza um modelo de decomposição salarial para lidar com múltiplos efeitos fixos no painel pareado de trabalhadores e firmas. Os efeitos puros da aglomeração (densidade) sobre os salários locais serão estimados em um modelo de dois estágios. O primeiro estágio estima uma equação salarial incluindo as características observadas dos trabalhadores e do emprego e os efeitos de localização, com um painel de micro dados da RAIS (2002-2014). O segundo estágio realiza a decomposição dos efeitos de localização em componentes associados às características locais dos arranjos e aos atributos não observados das firmas e dos trabalhadores. A estratégia de identificação propõe o controle dos efeitos fixos dos trabalhadores e firmas e o uso de variável instrumental para identificar os efeitos da aglomeração. Ademais, os dados de satélite sobre a luminosidade noturna são usados para estimar a proporção da área total dos arranjos habitada, a qual é utilizada para calcular a densidade. Os resultados mostraram que os efeitos do trabalhador foram mais relevantes do que os efeitos da firma para explicar a variação dos salários individuais e locais. O modelo principal, que utiliza o instrumento Bartik e a área iluminada, encontrou um efeito da densidade sobre os salários locais de 4,9%, o qual é superior ao lower bound da literatura prévia (3%). Os resultados sugerem que ignorar as limitações indicadas neste estudo pode levar a uma subestimação nas estimativas dos efeitos da densidade\\n""}"

The biblical myth of Lillith from the Talmud tells that she was Adam’s first wife and that she was punished by God for defending sexual pleasure and leaving her partner. On the one hand, Lillith represents the woman who rebels against the patriarchal order that controls her sexuality, and on the other, the individual who decides to live as an independent woman. Both of these stances make her a threat to the divine order. Escofet believes that Lillith has made frequent appearances throughout history in the guise of rebellious women traditionally labeled as bad. These include Joan of Arc, Anne Boleyn, The Bloody Countess, Mata Hari, and Bette Davis among others. Allende, in contrast, reconstructs the myth of Eve as a ‘pícara’, or, we might say, as the original Lillith. Her character recounts not only her own adventures and experiences but also those of other women who, in their rebellious opposition to traditional female roles, are considered bad or perverse. In these stories we find sexually precocious girls, prostitutes, mixed family groupings, and homosexual relationships presented as alternative possibilities for social organization.

The late Roman Empire was shaken to its foundations by near-constant bruising fights between rivals who wished to assume the purple. The Islamic Caliphate went through the turmoil of fitna; and in the long history of the Chinese Empire regimes and dynasties often succumbed to aggressive warlords. Throughout medieval and early modern Europe, internal conflicts between barons and kings, interspersed by many a jacquerie and fronde, were commonplace. In a multitude of countries the animosities and fervour of such ruptures (exemplified by the War of the Roses in England) fed them for long periods of time.

It also suggests that the ways adults talk about these benefits—and their wider biographical learning—can be used to identify a) foci for further national and pan-European analysis of the BeLL data; b) avenues for future research; and c) potentially fruitful theoretical lenses through which we can develop our understanding of the value of this and other interview data.""}"

Long before printing, scribal culture engaged with the various ways in which the knowledge of words might be organized and transmitted, often in the form of glosses on texts. Renaissance lexicography created dictionaries between different vernacular languages. Monolingual English dictionaries originally featured only difficult words, but in the 18th century Dr Johnson argued for the inclusion of ‘easy’ words and the omission of encyclopaedic information. In the 19th-century philological revolution, descriptivism displaced prescriptivism. This was exemplified in the OED. Modern dictionaries now draw on vast, computerized databases which can be analysed with far greater speed, rigour, and sophistication.""}"

While the 3C variant of BaRuO$_3$ is ferromagnetic below 60K, the 4H phase does not show any long-range magnetic order, however, there is experimental evidence of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations. Employing a combination of computational tools, namely density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we probe the origin of contrasting magnetic properties of BaRuO$_3$ in the 3C and 4H structures. Our study reveals that the difference in connectivity of RuO$_6$ octahedra in the two phases results in different Ru-O covalency, which in turn influences substantially the strengths of screened interaction values for Hubbard $U$ and Hund's rule $J$. With estimated $U$ and $J$ values, the 3C phase turns out to be a ferromagnetic metal, while the 4H phase shows paramagnetic behavior with vanishing ordered moments. However, this paramagnetic phase bears signatures of antiferromagnetic correlations, as confirmed by a calculation of the magnetic susceptibility. We find that the 4H phase is found to be at the verge of antiferromagnetic long-range order, which can be stabilized upon slight changes of screened Coulomb parameters $U$ and $J$, opening up the possibility of achieving a rare example of an antiferromagnetic metal.""}"

To ensure successful target attainment, therapeutic drug monitoring–informed dosage adjustment is recommended. However, it relies on the experience of the clinician and the frequency of drug measurements. This study aimed to design a new optimal dosing regimen of teicoplanin with a maintenance dosing strategy for neonates and children based on their physiological characteristics. Methods: Data from teicoplanin-treated patients (n = 214) were collected from electronic medical records. Covariate analyses were performed using population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling with 399 serum teicoplanin concentrations from 48 neonates and 166 children. Multiple PK simulations were conducted to explore optimal dosing regimens that would allow control of the trough concentration to the target of 15–30 mg/L quicker than the current standard regimen. Results: Allometrically scaled body weight, postmenstrual age (PMA), renal function, and serum albumin were implemented as substantial covariates for teicoplanin clearance in a two-compartment PK model. Covariate analyses and comprehensive simulation assessments recommended the following modifications to the current regimen: (1) decreased dose for premature babies (PMA ≤28 weeks), (2) decreased dose for children with renal dysfunction, and (3) increased dose for children (0.5–11 years) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Conclusions: This study leverages real-world clinical information and proposes new optimal dosing regimens for teicoplanin in neonates and children through PK modeling and simulation analyses, taking into account the age, including PMA, and renal function of patients.""}"

The animals were slaughtered after 3,5,6 and 7 month. The intervertebral disc and samples of the adjacent muscle were evaluated macroscopically and histologically for localisation of the material as well as signs for degeneration and inflammation. Samples of the spinal cord and dura mater were evaluated using PCR and immunhistochemistry for the presence of PGE 2 , iNOS, TNF .., IL-1, IL-6. ASD was found outside the intervertebral disc in all the cases. Both groups showed similar levels of degeneration and inflammation. Traces of ASD were found in the muscle in 58,3% with low to moderate levels of inflammation and degeneration in both groups. The implantgroup showed a tendency for comparatively higher values of IL-1 and iNOS. This study demonstrated a good biocompatability of ASD.

The amount of redundant information that is sensed is decreased due to optimal network coverage, which also reduces the restricted energy consumption of battery-powered sensors. WSN sensors can sense, receive, and send data concurrently. Along with the energy limitation, accurate sensors and non-redundant data are a crucial challenge for WSNs. To maximize the ideal coverage and reduce the waste of the constrained sensor battery lifespan, all these actions must be accomplished. Augmented Nature-inspired algorithm is showing promise as a solution to the crucial problems in “Wireless Sensor Networks” (WSNs), particularly those related to the reduced sensor lifetime. For “Wireless Sensor Networks” (WSNs) to provide the best coverage, we focus on algorithms that are inspired by Augmented Nature in this research. In wireless sensor networks, the cluster head is chosen using the Diversity-Driven Multi-Parent Evolutionary Algorithm. For Data encryption Improved Identity Based Encryption (IIBE) is used. For centralized optimization and reducing coverage gaps in WSNs Time variant Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used. The suggested model's metrics are examined and compared to various traditional algorithms. This model solves the reduced sensor lifetime and redundant information in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) as well as will give real and effective optimum coverage to the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).""}"

BoNTs act locally within motor neurons to elicit flaccid paralysis, while retrograde TeNT traffics to inhibitory neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) to elicit spastic paralysis. BoNT and TeNT are dichain proteins linked by an interchain disulfide bond comprised of an N-terminal catalytic light chain (LC) and a C-terminal heavy chain (HC) that encodes an LC translocation domain (HCT) and a receptor-binding domain (HCR). LC translocation is the least understood property of toxin action, but it involves low pH, proteolysis, and an intact interchain disulfide bridge. Recently, Pirazzini et al. (FEBS Lett 587:150–155, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.11.007 ) observed that inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) blocked TeNT and BoNT action in cerebellar granular neurons. In the current study, an atoxic TeNT LC translocation reporter was engineered by fusing β-lactamase to the N terminus of TeNT [βlac-TeNT(RY)] to investigate LC translocation in primary cortical neurons and Neuro-2a cells. βlac-TeNT(RY) retained the interchain disulfide bond, showed ganglioside-dependent binding to neurons, required acidification to promote βlac translocation, and was sensitive to auranofin, an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase. Mutation of βlac-TeNT(RY) at C439S and C467S eliminated the interchain disulfide bond and inhibited βlac translocation. These data support the requirement of an intact interchain disulfide for LC translocation and imply that disulfide reduction is a prerequisite for LC delivery into the host cytosol. The data also support a model that LC translocation proceeds from the C to the N terminus. βlac-TeNT(RY) is the first reporter system to measure translocation by an AB single-chain toxin in intact cells.""}"

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of selective interventions in Italy by describing the temporal trends and geographical distribution (a) of scrapie prevalence and (b) of the application of the National Genetic Selection Plan (NGSP). Poisson models were used to study temporal trends of disease prevalence (in terms of prevalence ratios, PR), whereas NGSP genotyping data from rams tested between 2005 and 2022 were used to study the temporal trend and geographical distribution of the percentage of susceptible animals. In addition, change-point regression analysis was used to identify changes in the trend. The trend in prevalence at the national level shows an increase in the period 2005–2015 (PR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.15), followed by a sharp decline between 2016 and 2022 (PR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.93).

His contributions to the fields of Sufism and Islamic philosophy have helped paint a clearer picture of the intellectual and spiritual landscape of Islamic civilization from the seventh/thirteenth century onwards. Yet Chittick is not simply concerned with discussions in Islamic thought as artifacts of premodern intellectualhistory. His vast knowledge of the Islamic intellectual tradition serves as the platform from which he seeks to address a broad range of contemporary issues. In this short essay, I will outline Chittick’s writingson the self within the context of his treatment of cosmology. Rather than being outdated ways of looking at the universe and our relationship to it, Chittick argues that traditional Islamic cosmological teachings are just as pertinent to the question of the self today as they were yesterday.&#x0D;""}"

Several recent studies have reported an association between the \""on-off\"" phenomenon, concurrent mood changes and sensory symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. In these reports, \""off\"" was associated with exacerbation of depression, anxiety and sensory symptoms, while \""on\"" was accompanied by normalization of mood with occasional elation and attenuation in the severity of the sensory symptoms. These observations suggest that the biological mechanisms of the \""on-off\"" interact with mechanisms regulating mood and sensory functions. The \""on-off\"" phenomenon may be related to primary degenerative changes in the locus coeruleus (LC). The emergence of mood changes and sensory symptoms associated with the \""on-off\"" may be facilitated by deregulation of LC-pineal melatonin functions. Administration of noradrenergic agents may be beneficial in attenuating the severity of the motor dyskinesias of the \""on-off\"" while serotonergic drugs alone or in combination with melatonin-release enhancing agents may be useful in the management of the mood changes and sensory symptoms.""}"

What of the adolescent, the individual whose body has almost finished growing and who has managed to learn a great deal about language and the manipulation of his human and non-human environment? We should consider this before turning our attention to adults. We might expect to see a smooth continuous progress, a steady growth of personality and physique from infancy to maturity. Instead, adolescence seems to be something of a hurdle, located at the time when the individual is no longer a child but is not yet fully accepted as a mature adult. In some cultures, this transition is marked by joyful celebration, with the adolescent being welcomed into the older group in an atmosphere of appreciation for the energy and enthusiasm that the young people bring to the management of group responsibilities. This is not characteristic of the so-called more advanced societies. For the past 70 years or more, western civilization has been trying to sort out a problem that it seems to have produced for itself.""}"

Second, to compare these optimal gestational ages with previously established optimal delivery timing for twin pregnancies not complicated by fetal growth restriction, which, in a previous individual patient meta-analysis, was calculated at 37 0/7 weeks of gestation for dichorionic pregnancies and 36 0/7 weeks for monochorionic pregnancies. DATA SOURCES: A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Ovid between 2015 and 2018 was performed of cohort studies reporting risks of stillbirth and neonatal death in twin pregnancies from 32 to 41 weeks of gestation. Studies from a previous meta-analysis using a similar search strategy (from inception to 2015) were combined. Women with monoamniotic twin pregnancies were excluded. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Overall, of 57 eligible studies, 20 cohort studies that contributed original data reporting on 7,474 dichorionic and 2,281 monochorionic twin pairs. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis to calculate the risk of perinatal death (risk difference between prospective stillbirth and neonatal death) per gestational week. Analyses were stratified by chorionicity, levels of growth discordance, and presence of SGA in one or both twins. For both dichorionic and monochorionic twins, the absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death were higher when one or both twins were SGA and increased with greater levels of growth discordance. Regardless of level of growth discordance and birth weight, perinatal risk balanced between 36 0/7–6/7 and 37 0/7–6/7 weeks of gestation in both dichorionic and monochorionic twin pregnancies, with likely higher risk of stillbirth than neonatal death from 37 0/7–6/7 weeks onward. CONCLUSION: Growth discordance or SGA is associated with higher absolute risks of stillbirth and neonatal death. However, balancing these two risks, we did not find evidence that the optimal timing of delivery is changed by the presence of growth disorders alone.

Our objective was to evaluate the safety of these IR models by comparing patients undergoing surgery with and without in vivo intestinal IR. Methods A retrospective study was performed comparing complication rates and severity, based on the Clavien-Dindo classification system, in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with (n = 10) and without (n = 20 matched controls) jejunal IR or colorectal surgery with (n = 10) and without (n = 20 matched controls) colon IR. Secondary outcome parameters were operative time, blood loss, 90-day mortality and length of hospital stay. Results Following pancreatic surgery, 63% of the patients experienced one or more postoperative complications. There was no significant difference in incidence or severity of complications between patients undergoing pancreatic surgery with (70%) or without (60%, P = 0.7) jejunal IR. Following colorectal surgery, 60% of the patients experienced one or more postoperative complication. Complication rate and severity were similar in patients with (50%) and without (65%, P = 0.46) colonic IR. Operative time, amount of blood loss, postoperative C-reactive protein, length of hospital stay or mortality were equal in both intervention and control groups for jejunal and colon IR. Conclusion This study showed that human experimental intestinal IR models are safe in patients undergoing pancreatic or colorectal surgery.""}"

We investigated the predictors for opioid requirements in upper limb fractures. Methods We retrospectively investigated all upper limb fractures from the shoulder to the wrist treated at a major trauma center from January 2015 to January 2022. The data collected consisted of fracture location, demographics, comorbidities, and management options. Post-injury opioid prescriptions in the first post-injury year were calculated every month up to six months and then grouped from the seventh to the 12th month and converted to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). We then calculated days requiring at least one medication (representing the \""coverage\"") and relative \""strength\"" in each time period. Results Six thousand four hundred thirteen patients sustaining a combined 9125 fractures were included in the study, with an MME mean of 436. Fracture locations of the scapula, proximal humerus, humeral shaft, distal humerus, and proximal ulna all had significantly higher MME requirements (p<0.05) at the one-year level. The radius shaft and distal radius had significantly lower MME requirements (p<0.05). The patients with depression, diabetes, drug abuse history, obesity, pulmonary circulatory disorder, and rheumatological conditions required higher strength of opioids at the one-year level (p<0.05). The patients with chronic kidney disease, depression, pulmonary circulation disorder, and rheumatological conditions required higher coverage of opioids at the one-year level (p<0.05). Conclusion Our study presents a high-resolution breakdown of the post-injury opioid requirements for patients with upper limb injuries. Fractures of the scapula, proximal humerus, and shaft of the humerus were associated with increases in both opioid strength and coverage. Depression, pulmonary disease, and rheumatological conditions were all associated with increased opioid strength and coverage. This provides a framework for which clinicians and patients can more accurately anticipate the course of the rehabilitation journey and risk stratify appropriately at the outset of injury.""}"

Desde el número anterior se presentan algunos de los trabajos de este evento y ambas editoriales tenían el objetivo de mostrar el estado actual de las prótesis ortopédicas en México y Colombia, sin embargo, dicho estudio o seguimiento por algún organismo de salud colombiano no se ha realizado de manera minuciosa. Dicha falencia hace difícil el trabajo de analizar las tendencias y determinar los casos de éxito para ortopedistas y médicos especializados en la rehabilitación de pacientes con complejidades ortopédicas; igualmente, dificulta el papel de los investigadores para entender las tendencias de los dispositivos y materiales actualmente usados y aplicados en la ortopedia. El análisis para Colombia se limita entonces a boletines incompletos o a publicaciones científicas, que por lo general describen materiales que están en etapas de desarrollo temprana, aún no aplicables a los pacientes. Aunque el Ministerio de Salud de Colombia reconoce dicha falencia, ha presentado algunos reportes en conjunto con el Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística (DANE), de los que se pueden interpretar algunas tendencias respecto a las personas con discapacidades, específicamente que limiten o imposibiliten su independencia, por afectaciones ortopédicas. Se estima que casi un 2,0 % de los colombianos padecen de discapacidad motriz, donde las principales causas están asociadas a accidentes de tránsito, víctimas del conflicto armado o patógenos. Sin embargo, dichos datos no coinciden con los presentados por el Registro de Localización y Caracterización de Personas con Discapacidad (RLCPD), que en su base de datos tiene identificadas 611.700 personas con discapacidad motriz (alrededor del 1,2% de la población colombiana). Se estima que entre el 10 y 20% de los discapacitados son amputados y necesitan una órtesis. Igualmente, el número total de artroplastias (reemplazos articulares), como las de cadera y rodilla, que se hacen al año son desconocidas y solo se encuentran algunos datos de estudios, difíciles de extrapolar, que se hacen dentro de clínicas u hospitales de algunas ciudades del país. Aún más complicado de analizar es el desconocido porcentaje de esta población afectada que ha sido tratada y poseen algún dispositivo o biomaterial que le ayude a tener una vida más “normal” en términos de autonomía motriz.&#x0D; Para tener una idea de las investigaciones sobre biomateriales (metálicos, poliméricos, cerámicos o compuestos) compatibles con el hueso realizadas en Colombia, se pueden hacer análisis de bases de datos. Por ejemplo, haciendo búsquedas en Scopus con las palabras “bone implants” y afiliaciones de los autores en Colombia, se encuentran alrededor de 160 publicaciones hechas en los últimos 10 años. La misma búsqueda, pero con afiliación en España, arroja como resultado 1849 publicaciones. Esto se podría relacionar con la baja inversión del gobierno colombiano en la investigación en general y al poco apoyo del sector privado, dada la difícil transferencia de los conocimientos alcanzados por las universidades colombianas hacía la industria. El sector de la salud importa distintos materiales para atender las necesidades ortopédicas de los pacientes colombianos, donde se podrían presentar alternativas nacionales más económicas por la eliminación de los costos de importación y la producción local a menores precios.&#x0D; Con este panorama, es claro que hay una considerable población del país que necesita intervenciones ortopédicas para mejorar su calidad de vida, pero que la deficiente vigilancia y seguimiento a las personas discapacitadas y a los procedimientos quirúrgicos ortopédicos han podido afectar la inversión pública o privada en la investigación y desarrollo de prótesis, órtesis y biomateriales óseos. Por ello, en esta Editorial se pretende llamar la atención e invitar al gobierno colombiano a un mejor seguimiento de las personas con afectaciones de la movilidad, la cantidad de artroplastias efectuadas por año y a apoyar la investigación de las universidades nacionales en temas ortopédicos para generar productos de gran beneficio a menores precios.""}"

In addition, there is a need for teaching-learning beyond the classrooms in emergencies like the prevailing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease / COVID-19. The adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools will not suffice all these requirements. Interactive teaching-learning would help to convert bookish information into life-long knowledge. Case-based problem-solving questions would create the need for thinking. The blending of skills and knowledge will inculcate value and confidence in students along with their university degrees. A pre-study perception survey was performed to understand the educational needs of students and expectations of parents and the pharma industry, followed by activities to promote interactive teaching-learning in a selected institute. The post-study feedback survey revealed interesting results, which will, boosts effective knowledge dissemination along with improved student attendance. Key words: Interactive, Teaching, Learning, Thinking, Examination.""}"

The author introduces a model of higher learning that captures a traditional linear paradigm of how higher learning unfolds. He then argues that effective use of that paradigm presupposes that students possess well-honed skills in concentration and contemplation, but that they often do not possess them. Thus, educators (at least those of us who use versions of the traditional paradigm) need to broaden curricula to include methods of learning that develop and polish these essential skills. As support, the author develops an argument for the importance of concentration and contemplation as foundational academic competencies. Finally, he introduces a demystified version of a traditional meditation/contemplative practice—the author's lesson in learning to learn—and argues that use of this model can enhance the development of mature academic skills.""}"

QAIP is an important component of internal auditors’ commitment to improve internal audit (IA) quality. The pressure towards improvement is urgent for central banks, in light of the vulnerabilities of their IA functions identified by the International Monetary Fund. The authors analyse the professional standards and the literature on IA and QAIP, aiming to propose general considerations to enhance IA quality and to develop and maintain a QAIP, with reference to central banks, also shedding light on the synergies among IA, QAIP and total quality management (TQM). Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews the most relevant professional standards in light of the professional and academic literature regarding IA quality, QAIP and their relationship with TQM. The analysis of these sources represents an important step to identify general measures to improve IA quality and develop effective QAIP in central banks. Findings This analysis shows that it is important to understand the rationale behind the development of an IA function and its theoretical and practical foundation, especially for complex organisations such as central banks. In addition, the authors show that QAIP represents an important tool to exploit the synergies between TQM and IA. These synergies could result in higher levels of quality for the IA function and more effective implementation of TQM within the whole organisation. Lastly, the authors provide practical suggestions to support the implementation of an effective QAIP in central banks and to spread TQM philosophy within the organisation. Originality/value The authors contribute to the scant literature on IA quality and QAIP by focusing on central banks and shedding light on the relationship with TQM. Regardless of their importance, these topics have been largely neglected by the extant literature.""}"

This study documents how stiffness and strength of wettability-altered oil and water-saturated (mixed wet) Mons chalk compare to water-saturated and water wet samples during hydrostatic loading and creep. During hydrostatic creep, the strain rate response to magnesium chloride (MgCl 2 ) brine injection is compared for water wet and mixed wet samples. For the mixed wet samples, the oil production was estimated during compaction and non-equilibrium MgCl 2 flow. The results presented here were then compared to a similar test series on Kansas outcrop chalk. The differences were interpreted in terms of difference in physical parameters such as porosity and pore size. Two Mons samples were wettability-altered and tested in parallel to two completely water wet samples from the same chalk block at hydrostatic conditions and 130 °C. It was found that beyond the experimental uncertainty, the stiffness and yield strength measurements showed insignificant differences for water wet and mixed wet Mons samples. This is contrary to Kansas chalk where mixed wet samples were systematically stronger and stiffer than water wet samples. In the following creep phase, both water wet and wettability-altered Mons chalk samples gave trends comparable to each other during a stagnant phase and a following MgCl 2 injection phase at varying flow rates. Similar observations were reported for water wet and wettability-altered Kansas chalks as well. Further, the same chemical reactions were observed for Kansas and Mons chalks and were found to be insensitive to the initial wettability and oil/water saturations. The oil production observations from Mons chalk showed that 43% of the total oil was recovered during early-stage compaction with no flow, whereas Kansas chalk did not produce any oil at no-flow conditions. After the oil recovery from the first 2–3 pore volumes of brine flow, no further oil production was observed due to compaction or non-equilibrium brine flow in any of the two chalk types.""}"

The study of surface phonons by means of an optical spectroscopy such as BLS has been historically constrained to nontransparent and highly reflecting bulk and film samples or even to very thin films deposited on reflecting substrates. Probably due to its low signal and to the narrow window in experimental conditions, it was assumed for years that bulk transparent samples were not suited for Brillouin spectroscopy in order to get information on SAWs, negating this optical technique in the search for SAW properties. The reported experiments on transparent glasses and single crystals (cubic MgO and trigonal sapphire) prove that there is no intrinsic physical reason not to collect SAW propagation velocity data from transparent bulk samples and opens a challenge to apply the Brillouin spectroscopy in a wider scenario to obtain direct information, in a nondestructive and contactless way, about SAWs in bulk materials.""}"

We then deduce the driving force, the progressive mechanisms, and the major steps of CBE evolution from thermodynamics. We hence establish a comprehensive evolutionary theory termed the CBE evolutionary theory (CBEET), which suggests that evolution is driven hierarchy-wise by thermodynamics and favors fitness and diversity. The CBEET provides novel explanations for origin of life (abiogenesis), macroevolution, natural selection, sympatric speciation, and animal group evolution in a comprehensive and comprehensible way. It elucidates that collaboration, altruism, obeying rules with properly increased freedom are important throughout the CBE evolution. It refutes thoroughly the notion that negative entropy (negentropy) leads to biological order which is distinct from thermodynamic order. It integrates with research advances in multiple disciplines and links up laws of physics, evolution in biology, and harmonious development of human society.""}"

Then the abundance of stone loach was related to the scores of the retained axes (eigenvalues &gt;1). The abundance of stone loach was positively correlated to substrate particle size, amount of shade, temperature, discharge and current velocity, but negatively correlated to brown trout abundance. Secondly, a month‐long field enclosure experiment in a stream was performed to test for any negative effects of brown trout on stone loach growth. Four treatments were used: intraspecific competition (stone loach at double density), interspecific competition (stone loach + small trout), predation (stone loach + large trout) and a control (stone loach alone). The results showed that large trout tended to have negative effects on final stone loach biomass. The absence of a negative effect of large trout on resource density suggests that nonlethal effects rather than resource competition caused this trend.""}"

The experimental spectrum was compared with IR transition frequencies computed from ab initio theory for o-D2−OH and p-D2−OH. The state-selective IR excitation of D2−OH also serves to initiate inelastic and/or reactive scattering dynamics between the D2 and OH partners under restricted initial orientation conditions. Time- and frequency-resolved measurements of the OH (v = 1) fragments from vibrational predissociation showed that vibrationally activated D2−OH is short-lived and that the D2 fragment is vibrationally excited as a result of an efficient near-resonant vibration-to-vibration energy transfer process. The remaining 350 cm-1 of available energy is disposed primarily as rotational excitation of OH. The OH fragments also exhibit a striking lambda-doublet preference, revealing alignment of the unpaired pπ orbital with respect to the OH rotation plane that changes with the intermolecular state selected.

The pool of thyroid hormones critical for the biological actions of the hormones is the pool of free thyroid hormone. The size of this pool is determined for short time periods by uptake/release of thyroid hormones into/from cell and binding/release of thyroid hormones by thyroid hormone-binding proteins. Both proportions and absolute concentrations of these proteins differ in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The most pronounced difference is found for TTR which is the only thyroid hormone-binding plasma protein synthesized in the brain. TTR is also distinct from the other two thyroid hormone-binding plasma proteins in humans by the absence of genetic deficiencies. TTR gene expression was initiated during evolution much earlier in the brain than in the liver. The structure of the domains of TTR involved in thyroxine (TR) T4 binding has been completely conserved for 350 million years. These observations point to a special functional significance of TTR in the brain. It is proposed that this is the determination of the level of free T4 in the extracellular compartment of the brain. T4 can then be converted in the brain to triiodothyronine T3 by specific deiodinases. This T3 can interact with receptors in the cell nuclei, regulating gene transcription.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)""}"

Nie ulega wątpliwości, że uzasadnienia ładu prawnego i politycznego dostarczone przez Thomasa Hobbesa, Samuela Pufendorfa, Johna Locke’a czy Jean-Jacquesa Rousseau, a także licznych ówczesnych teoretyków jurysprudencji, stały się podstawą legitymizacji nowożytnych systemów politycznych. Pojęcie umowy społecznej służyło w tych doktrynach do wyjaśnienia i uzasadnienia właściwego - z perspektywy założonych właściwości i potrzeb natury ludzkiej - ładu społeczno-politycznego. Odmienne założenia w rozważaniach o naturze ludzkiej prowadziły wobec tego do odmiennych ujęć stanu natury, umowy społecznej i - wreszcie - stanu społecznego (stanu społeczeństwa cywilnego). Można mimo to zidentyfikować wspólny element doktryn kontr aktualnych, mianowicie założenie, że jedynie świadoma i wiążąca zgoda racjonalnych jednostek, przełamujących swe naturalne namiętności4, mogła być podstawą normatywną społeczeństwa obywatelskiego (moment „umowy o stowarzyszenie”) oraz porządku instytucjonalnego warunkującego to społeczeństwo, w tym zwłaszcza władzy politycznej (moment „umowy o podporządkowanie”). Popularność doktryn kontr aktualnych w XVII i XVIII stuleciu doprowadziła do osłabienia, a wręcz załamania wcześniejszych ujęć prawnonaturalnych, które podkreślały teleologiczne „zakotwiczenie” państwa (wspólnoty politycznej), ujmowane w pismach Arystotelesa i św. Tomasza z Akwinu jako oczywiste, właściwe człowiekowi z natury i służące realizacji dobra wspólnego czy też spełniające szczególną rolę w planie Opatrzności. Kontr aktualna reakcja na scholastyczne propozycje uzasadnienia ładu, wskazująca na szczególną rolę indywidualnego rozumu ludzkiego, pozbawionego jakiejkolwiek transcendentnej orientacji i odniesienia do Rozumu Bożego, bez wątpienia potwierdza „pęknięcie” w filozofii zachodniej, które trwało co najmniej od czasów Wilhelma z Ockham, Marsyliusza z Padwy czy Nicolli Machiavellego i zostało potwierdzone w następstwie Reformacji. Przejawiało się ono w stopniowej „sekularyzacji” rozważań o polityce wraz z towarzyszącym temu przeniesieniem akcentu z powinności moralnych na uprawnienia indywidualne. Te dwa przeciwstawne modele legitymizacji ładu i państwa nie wyczerpują jednak pełnego spektrum uzasadnień. W owym czasie pojawiły się bowiem ujęcia, które nie dają się sprowadzić wprost do żadnego ze stanowisk w tym konflikcie, choć zarazem pozostawały w ścisłym związku z ówczesnymi tendencjami filozoficznymi. Należą do nich zwłaszcza koncepcje przedstawione przez czołowych przedstawicieli szkockiego Oświecenia, jak David Hume (1711-1776), Henry Home (lepiej znany jako lord Kames, 1696-1782), Adam Smith (1723-1790) i Adam Ferguson (1723-1816). Filozofowie szkoccy, których nie można zaliczyć do klasycznej, arystotelesowsko-tomistycznej tradycji prawa natury (tzw. scholastycznej), gwałtownie odrzuconej w krajach protestanckich, sprzeciwili się jednak równie silnie rozmaitym wyjaśnieniom kontr aktualnym (szczególnie autorstwa Hobbesa i Locke’a), które zdominowały ówczesną jurysprudencję. Proponowali w zamian model samorzutnego wyłaniania się instytucji społecznych, niezależnie od różnych poglądów na temat źródeł normatywnych podstaw ładu społecznego, tj. praw natury (ujmowanych przez Hume’a jako konwencjonalne - lecz nie kontr aktualne, a przez innych jako naturalne).""}"

In this article I review the book and return to some of the key issues raised by MacAskill's decision and the broader context in which it was made. I argue that the book sheds little new light on Lockerbie and that it falls short in precisely the areas where MacAskill might have the most insight to offer.

Hence, we aim to study the model of the failure times of ball bearings. A hybrid Type-II censoring scheme is recommended to minimize the experimental time and cost where the components are following alpha power inverse Weibull distribution. A ball bearing is one example; the other is the resistance of guinea pigs exposed to dosages of virulent tubercle bacilli. We use different estimation methods to obtain point and interval estimates of the unknown parameters of the distribution; consequently, estimating statistical functions such as the hazard rate and the survival functions are observed. The maximum likelihood method and the maximum product spacing methods are used, in addition to the Bayesian estimation method, in which symmetric and asymmetric loss functions are utilized. Interval estimators are obtained for the unknown parameters using three different criteria: approximate, credible, and bootstrap confidence intervals. The performance of the parameters’ estimation is accomplished via simulation analysis and numerical methods such as Newton–Raphson and Monte Carlo Markov chains. Finally, results and conclusions support the suitability of alpha power inverse Weibull distribution under a hybrid Type-II censoring scheme for modeling real biomedical data.""}"

METHODS: This study evaluated 774 eyes of 774 patients who underwent cataract surgery with TECNIS Multifocal ZLB00 lens (Johnson &amp; Johnson Surgical Vision) implantation. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (CASIA2; Tomey Corporation) was performed as a part of the preoperative eye examination. Sex, age, axial length, and CASIA2 parameters, such as crystalline lens diameter and lens tilt relative to the corneal topographic axis, were investigated. The eyes considered were classified into good (20/20 or better) or poor (worse than 20/20) far vision groups based on corrected distance visual acuity, and good (20/25 or better) or poor (worse than 20/25) near vision groups based on distance-corrected near visual acuity, respectively. Preoperative characteristics of both groups were compared to determine factors affecting postoperative visual acuity. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older age ( P &lt; .001), a short axial length ( P = .010), and a large lens tilt ( P &lt; .001) were associated with poor near vision. There was no significant difference between the two far vision groups. There was a significant negative correlation between lens tilt and axial length ( r = −0.513, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that age, axial length, and lens tilt to the corneal topographic axis may predict poor visual acuity after the implantation of a diffractive multifocal intraocular lens. Eyes with a short axial length tended to have a large degree of lens tilt and should be considered particularly carefully. [ J Refract Surg . 2021;37(10):674–679.]""}"

Its first great master work – Euclid's ‘Elements’ – which helped to establish the field and demonstrate the power of its methods, was written about 2400 years ago; and it served as a standard text in the mathematics curriculum well into the twentieth century. By contrast, the first comparable master work of physics – Newton's Principia – was written 300 odd years ago. And the juvenile science of biology only got its first master work – Darwin's ‘On the Origin of Species’ – a mere 150 years ago. The development of the subject has also been extraordinarily fertile, particularly in the last three centuries, and it is perhaps only in the last century that the other sciences have begun to approach mathematics in the steady accumulation of knowledge that it has been able to offer. There has, moreover, been almost universal agreement on its methods and how they are to be applied. What we require is proof; and, in practice, there is very little disagreement over whether or not we have it. The other sciences, by contrast, tend to get mired in controversy over the significance of this or that experimental finding or over whether one theory is to be preferred to another.""}"

For each cerebral defect, the main imaging findings are reminded, certain differential diagnoses are discussed and prenatal diagnostic accuracy is analyzed with emphasis on uncertainties encountered during analysis of ultrasound or magnetic resonance images. Detecting cerebral lesions in fetuses requires rapid counseling by neuropediatricians. Keeping in mind that the prenatal diagnostic accuracy is not 100%, the neuropediatricians have to answer the parents' questions regarding the outcome of the unborn child as well as the risk of recurrence for future pregnancies. This article is based on the authors' large experience in both prenatal imaging and neurocounseling. The frequently asked questions are set up. Answers are provided, underscoring the importance of an appropriate description of the cerebral defect, and therefore the pivotal role of prenatal imaging. However, prenatal neurocounseling remains challenging and the parents must be aware of uncertainties regarding both diagnostic accuracy and prognostic evaluation.""}"

Ozanimod has previously demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in a phase 2 study (TOUCHSTONE). Here we report data from a 10-week induction period in the phase 3, double-blind, True North study (NCT02435992). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ozanimod in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with moderate-to-severe UC. Results from the maintenance period are reported separately. METHODS: Adults with moderately-to-severely active UC (total Mayo score 6-12 with a Mayo endoscopy subscore ≥2 and on oral aminosalicylates or corticosteroids) were randomized 2:1 to receive oral ozanimod HCl 1 mg (equivalent to ozanimod 0.92 mg) or placebo once daily during a 10-week randomized induction period. Randomization was stratified by prior tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) use and corticosteroid use at screening. The primary endpoint in the induction period was the proportion of patients in clinical remission using the 3-component Mayo score (rectal bleeding score = 0, stool frequency score ≤1 and decrease from baseline ≥1, and endoscopy subscore ≤1) at week 10. Ranked key secondary endpoints were proportions of patients with clinical response (based on 3-component Mayo score), endoscopic improvement (Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤1 without friability), and mucosal healing (endoscopic improvement plus histological remission). Histologic remission was a pre-specified secondary (non-ranked) endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 645 patients were randomized to receive ozanimod (n = 429) or placebo (n = 216); 94% and 89%, respectively, completed the induction period. At week 10, 18.4% and 6.0% of patients in the ozanimod and placebo groups, respectively, achieved clinical remission (difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 7.5-17.2]; P < 0.0001). All key secondary efficacy endpoints showed statistically greater improvements with ozanimod vs placebo. Clinical response was achieved in 47.8% vs 25.9%, endoscopic improvement in 27.3% vs 11.6%, and mucosal healing in 12.6% vs 3.7% for ozanimod vs placebo (all P < 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved histologic remission with ozanimod (defined as Geboes <2, 18.2% vs 7.4%; Geboes ≤3.1, 34.7% vs 18.5%; and Geboes ≤1.1, 26.3% vs 11.1% for ozanimod vs placebo, respectively; P < 0.001 for all). In patients with prior TNFi exposure, the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission favored ozanimod but was not significant vs placebo (10.0% vs 4.6%, P = 0.195), while the proportion of patients with clinical response was statistically superior for ozanimod (36.9% vs 18.5%, P = 0.008) at week 10. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) for patients who received ozanimod vs placebo, respectively, were anemia (4.2% vs 5.6%), nasopharyngitis (3.5% vs 1.4%), and headache (3.3% vs 1.9%). Cardiovascular events were infrequent and included bradycardia (0.5% vs 0%) and hypertension (1.4% vs 0%). Serious TEAEs occurred in 4.0% vs 3.2%, respectively. Serious infections occurred in <1% per group. CONCLUSION: Ozanimod induction for 10 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe UC resulted in statistically significant improvements in clinical remission, clinical response, endoscopic improvement, mucosal healing, and histologic remission. Ozanimod was well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed.""}"

Transarterial embolization (TAE) is the first-line treatment, but the optimal embolic agent remains debated. This study reports on the use of a low-viscosity EVOH copolymer (Squid Peri12) in the emergency management of r-HCC. Methods Four patients presenting with r-HCC underwent emergency TAE using Squid Peri12. Diagnosis of rupture was based on clinical symptoms and characteristic imaging findings, including hemoperitoneum. TAE was performed via superselective catheterization using a DMSO-compatible microcatheter, with slow injection under fluoroscopic guidance. Tumor response was assessed using modified RECIST and volumetric analysis at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results Technical success was achieved in all cases, with immediate bleeding control and no procedure-related complications. Portal vein patency was preserved, and all patients were discharged within 3–5 days. At follow-up, all patients showed sustained devascularization and tumor shrinkage, with an average volume reduction exceeding 60% at 6 months. Two patients became eligible for curative-intent surgery after marked radiologic and biologic response, including one with AFP decline from 3500 to 27 ng/mL. A third declined surgery despite downstaging, and one demonstrated complete radiologic response without additional treatment. Conclusion TAE with low-viscosity EVOH was safe and effective in the acute setting of r-HCC, achieving rapid hemostasis and consistent tumor regression. These findings support further prospective evaluation of non-adhesive liquid embolics beyond emergent indications, including their potential oncologic role in unresectable HCC.

Despite being a global problem, antimicrobial resistance is often geographically heterogeneous. Thus, it is fundamental to know local epidemiology and practice frequent surveillance of each hospital's antibiograms. The aims of this study are to determine the local antimicrobial resistance profile in pediatric UTIs, to understand its evolution over 14 years, and finally, to infer if the currently instituted antibiotic empirical therapy remains effective. Materials and methods A retrospective observational study was performed through the analysis of urine cultures and respective antibiograms of children diagnosed with UTI from 2017 to 2019 in Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Algarve (Faro's unit, Portugal), followed by a comparison of the obtained data with the results of a similar study performed between 2003 and 2005. Results A total of 784 urine cultures were selected. <i>Escherichia coli</i> was the most frequent microorganism (n = 561; 71.56%), followed by <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> (n = 117; 14.92%) and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (n = 40; 5.10%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotic was cefuroxime axetil (66.28%). <i>Escherichia coli</i> had an increase in resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate of 6.16% to 34.76% and cefuroxime axetil of 0.73% to 4.46%. <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> had an increase in resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanate of 1.64% to 11.11%. <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> had an increase in resistance to cefuroxime axetil (0%-27.50%) and nitrofurantoin (0%-47.50%). The three microorganisms showed a decrease in trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance profiles, as well as low resistance profiles to fosfomycin. In fifty cases in which antibiotic empirical therapy was instituted, the isolated microorganism revealed <i>in vitro</i> resistance; 37 of these cases had a good evolution, maintaining the antibiotic empirical therapy. Discussion Local surveillance of antimicrobial resistance allows monitoring of the resistance trends and adequacy of empirical antibiotic therapy. This study's local resistance profile was distinct from other regions of the country and the world. Continuous local surveillance also potentiates the dissemination of the results to the concerned healthcare providers and the initiation of timely responsive measures, containing the increase in antimicrobial resistance. As <i>Escherichia coli</i> was the commonest isolated microorganism, its antimicrobial profile should dictate antibiotic empirical therapy. This study supports that <i>in vitro</i> is not equivalent to <i>in vivo</i> resistance. Conclusion There was a significant increase in antimicrobial resistance profiles, especially to amoxicillin-clavulanate. Cefuroxime axetil remains the recommended antibiotic for empirical therapy in this hospital, although fosfomycin should be considered as an alternative in non-complicated cystitis in adolescent females. This study reinforces the importance of continuous local resistance surveillance as a preventive measure against the global increase in antimicrobial resistance.""}"

Results and Conclusions: Although the Decree takes advantage of many of the European General Data Protection Regulation's principles, i.e., the rights of data subjects, consent requirements, and the need for impact assessments, it has its provisions specific to the Vietnamese context, such as the absence of \""legitimate interests\"" as a legal basis for processing and the unique enforcement mechanisms. Despite many similarities, the specific requirements around consent, data subject rights, breach notification, extraterritorial data transfers, and enforcement mechanisms might result in conflicts among these legislative documents. The Decree, which would become more effective, shall rely on its enforcement mechanisms and the ability to impose meaningful sanctions for non-compliance; thus, it should incorporate a more detailed sanctions regime to deter violations effectively.""}"

An analysis of the sources of growth is an allocation of changes in output among these determinants. Total factor input and output per unit of input condense all determinants into two groupings. Misinterpretation of results is common because authors presenting either detailed or summary results often provide no complete or precise description of their classification of determinants, and readers ignore even the information provided. The classification suggested in this paper is detailed enough to bring out points at which description is required but often overlooked. Some effects of alternative estimating procedures on classification are described. The relative usefulness and practicality of possible alternative classifications also need consideration and discussion. This paper is concerned with general purpose classifications, appropriate for analysis of actual series measuring a country's total output, that are suitable for present use but will also accommodate useful detail that may later become feasible. A desirable classification will so specify determinants that (1) they both unite cause with effect and correspond to the economist's method of analysis so that his set of tools can be brought to bear; (2) they do not contribute to growth if they do not change; and (3) they conform as well as possible to practical possibility of estimation. Among several points considered fundamental are that the complete contributions of advances in knowledge and of resource reallocation each appear as an entity. They should not be dispersed among inputs or other determinants. It is less clear whether economies of scale should be a separate determinant or their contribution be dispersed.""}"

Additional information was gathered in Burgundy vineyards on « Pinot noir » and « Chardonnay » varieties. A relationship between the sugar content (°Brix) and water content of a berry was observed, which was robust and identical for all varieties. The asynchronous nature of berry growth was confirmed and densimetry allows quantifying the homogeneity of harvest. A model was proposed to modelling dry matter growth, based on thermal time and final potential dry weight. A single relationship was obtained for the two varieties studied which seemed to be independent of field conditions (soil and year).

It binds to monomeric Aβ as well as mature fibrils and is capable of inhibiting their aggregation. We recently showed that L-PGDS could successfully breakdown mature Aβ fibrils (manuscript submitted), which opens avenues for its use as a therapeutic agent in cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). &#13;\\nThis thesis is aimed at utilizing the theranostic (therapeutic + diagnostic) potential of L-PGDS in AD by early detection of Aβ using MRI. For this purpose, we covalently conjugated the recombinant L-PGDS protein with iron oxide-based nanoparticles with different outer coatings. Four different nanoparticles were compared for their T2 contrast enhancement. The functionality of the conjugated protein, its inhibition activity towards Aβ, the effect on cellular viability and the tendency to form aggregates were compared to choose the most efficient composition. For this purpose, we used a multi-disciplinary approach using chemical and biophysical assays, spectrophotometric techniques, structural and morphological studies, cellular assays and tissue histology, and pre-clinical mouse imaging to develop an L-PGDS-based theranostic molecular probe. Based on the results of in vitro assay, the biological probes designed by covalent conjugation of magnetic resonance active ferritin protein nanocages conjugated with L-PGDS were used for studies in AD mice. Injections in diseased mice showed hypointensity in mouse brain areas correlated with the presence of amyloid-rich structures compared to age-matched healthy mice. &#13;\\nAll MRI data were acquired using Bruker spectrometers, and Paravision 6.0 software was used for processing and analysis. T2 relaxation curves were prepared for nanoparticles to compare relaxivity differences in the biological buffer. Differences in T2-star weighted image intensities were identified in the brains of healthy mice after non-invasive intranasal administration of conjugated L-PGDS probes. L-PGDS conjugated with ferritin nanocages injected in the ventricular chambers were seen to disperse towards the amyloid-rich brain regions in AD mice. To this end, we have shown here that L-PGDS protein has great outlook as a diagnostic agent for early identification of AD hallmarks in disease-prone populations, and potential as a therapeutic intervention.""}"

The proof of unsoundness exploits the category of singular terms with a compositionally complex semantics that are nevertheless directly referential, such as ‘7 + 1’; they must not be confused with definite descriptions. The proof depends on the standard logic of identity, not on any intensionalist assumption. The errors in our pre-theoretic essentialists judgments are explained by our reliance on an efficient but fallible heuristic. The analogous premises of Fine’s argument are generated by the same heuristic and so are untrustworthy. More generally, it is suggested, hyperintensionalist theorizing is guilty of overfitting dodgy data.

Despite WHO’s assertion that disabled persons deserve equal access to healthcare, disparities remain. Health professionals play a pivotal role in reducing maternal mortality. Yet few studies engage professionals to understand these perceptions and how they shape service provision. This highlights the need for research investigating health professionals’ perceptions of delivering maternal healthcare to women with disabilities in Ghana. With the aid of a qualitative approach, this study explored the perceptions of healthcare professionals on disabled women who sought maternal healthcare in Ghana. Data was gathered from 25 healthcare workers, consisting of midwives and doctors. The thematic analysis uncovered two contrasting themes—positive perceptions highlighting the determination and strength of disabled women and negative perceptions shaped by cultural biases questioning the need for disabled women to become pregnant. Bridging this gap necessitates comprehensive training, patient-centred collaborative approaches, and anti-discrimination policies to establish an equitable Ghanaian healthcare system that safeguards the reproductive rights and options of pregnant and disabled women. Dedication from all stakeholders is imperative to ensure inclusiveness and fair treatment.""}"

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the transmission of wound signals by MAPKs has been the subject of detailed investigations; however, the involvement of specific phosphatases in wound signaling is not known. Here, we show that AP2C1, an Arabidopsis Ser/Thr phosphatase of type 2C, is a novel stress signal regulator that inactivates the stress-responsive MAPKs MPK4 and MPK6. Mutant ap2c1 plants produce significantly higher amounts of jasmonate upon wounding and are more resistant to phytophagous mites (Tetranychus urticae). Plants with increased AP2C1 levels display lower wound activation of MAPKs, reduced ethylene production, and compromised innate immunity against the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Our results demonstrate a key role for the AP2C1 phosphatase in regulating stress hormone levels, defense responses, and MAPK activities in Arabidopsis and provide evidence that the activity of AP2C1 might control the plant's response to B. cinerea.""}"

Since patients with multiple enchondromas have occasionally been reported to have these conditions, we hypothesized that the same mutations would occur in cartilaginous neoplasms. Approximately 1200 mesenchymal tumours, including 220 cartilaginous tumours, 222 osteosarcomas and another ∼750 bone and soft tissue tumours, were screened for IDH1 R132 mutations, using Sequenom ® mass spectrometry. Cartilaginous tumours and chondroblastic osteosarcomas, wild‐type for IDH1 R132, were analysed for IDH2 (R172, R140) mutations. Validation was performed by capillary sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. Heterozygous somatic IDH1/IDH2 mutations, which result in the production of a potential oncometabolite, 2‐hydroxyglutarate, were only detected in central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours, and were found in at least 56% of these, ∼40% of which were represented by R132C. IDH1 R132H mutations were confirmed by immunoreactivity for this mutant allele. The ratio of IDH1:IDH2 mutation was 10.6 : 1. No IDH2 R140 mutations were detected. Mutations were detected in enchondromas through to conventional central and dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas, in patients with both solitary and multiple neoplasms. No germline mutations were detected. No mutations were detected in peripheral chondrosarcomas and osteochondromas. In conclusion, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations represent the first common genetic abnormalities to be identified in conventional central and periosteal cartilaginous tumours. As in gliomas and AML, the mutations appear to occur early in tumourigenesis. We speculate that a mosaic pattern of IDH ‐mutation‐bearing cells explains the reports of diverse tumours (gliomas, AML, multiple cartilaginous neoplasms, haemangiomas) occurring in the same patient.

Conflicts in regional areas would affect security because geographically, Indonesia was very close to this area and even directly in contact with the North Natuna Sea. The conflict would also have an impact on economic conditions, because the Natuna sea area was the crossing area of international ships that were going to industrial areas, including Indonesia. The purpose of this article was to analyzed the threats and reconstruct Indonesia's maritime security in the context of realizing national resilience. The case study of this research was on the Natuna sea conflict. This research used descriptive qualitative data analysis techniques. Based on the analysis, the threat analysis had been seen through response management against the form of violation in the Natuna sea area, by Bakamla RI, Lanal, Lantamal, and the Regional Government, also the Central Government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This could be used as a form of development (reconstruction) for Indonesian Maritime Resilience in order to provided support for national resilience to strengthened national defense. ABSTRAK Terdapat beberapa hal yang menjadi poin penting bagi Indonesia dengan memperhatikan beberapa hal yaitu pertama, Indonesia harus mewaspadai situasi keamanan di Laut Natuna Utara yang sering terjadi sengketa oleh beberapa negara kawasan. Konflik di daerah kawasan akan mempengaruhi keamanan karena secara geografis wilayah Indonesia sangat berdekatan dengan wilayah tersebut dan bahkan bersinggungan langsung dengan wilayah Laut Natuna Utara. Konflik juga akan berimbas dengan kondisi ekonomi, dikarenakan wilayah laut Natuna merupakan perlintasan internasional kapal-kapal yang hendak berlayar menuju wilayah industrial termasuk Indonesia. Artikel ini bertujuan menganalisis ancaman dan rekontruksi kemanan maritim Indonesia dalam rangka mewujudkan ketahanan nasional.Studi kasus penelitian ini pada konflik perairan Natuna. Penelitian ini menggunakan teknik analisis data kualitatif deskriptif.Berdasarkan analisis, analisis ancaman sudah terlihat melalui manajemen respon terhadap bentuk pelanggaran di wilayah periaran Natuna, oleh Bakamla RI, Lanal, Lantamal dan Pemerintah Daerah, serta Pemerintah Pusat Melalui Kementerian Luar Negeri. Hal inilah yang dapat dijadikan sebagai bentuk bangunan (rekonstruksi) terhadap Ketahanan Maritim Indonesia guna memberikan dukungan terhadap ketahanan nasional untuk memperkuat pertahanan negara.""}"

Relman"", ""affiliations"": [""Harvard Medical School, USA""], ""is_corresponding"": true}], ""abstract"": ""Prologue: In the six years that Arnold Relman has served as editor of The New England Journal of Medicine , this weekly publication has devoted evermore attention and space to publishing a range of views on health policy issues. The emphasis is in keeping with Relman s penchant to inform his largely physician audience on issues beyond their everyday clinical activities. Obviously, though, the central purpose of the journal is to keep practitioners on the cutting edge of change in clinical medicine. Relman, a philosopher-physician who brings to his editorship a thirty-year perspective as a nephrologist, medical educator, and clinical researcher, often contributes to this dialogue, offering opinions on subjects ranging from nuclear war and physicians to treatment of end-stage renal disease to Moscow in January and more. But in no instance has Relman devoted more space or personal fervor than he did in the fall of 1980 when he wrote “The New Medical-Industrial Complex,” an article that remains as controversial today as the day it was published. Relman's focus is the physician and his (and increasingly) her role in society. Relman believes to the core of his professional being that medical practice has a crucial moral component: the commitment of the doctor to the patient, to put the patient's interest above his own, and always to do what is in the patient's best interest to the best of his ability. He said in an interview not long ago: “When doctors begin seeing themselves as businessmen, simply selling a highly technical service, that will be the beginning of the end for the profession. “In this article, adapted from the Merrimon Lecture which Relman delivered at the University of North Carolina last October, he urges the medical profession to recognize this danger and address it. Relman asks not that society change, but that doctors be steadfast in maintaining “responsible professionalism.” He has delivered this plea to the American Medical Associations Board of Trustees and in other bastions of medical influence. Coming as it does from the most powerful man in medical publishing today, it's not a message that the profession can afford to take lightly.""}"

This clearly suggests that the key to a reduction of the HIV infection rate is a change in our sexual behaviour. In this article, therefore, I want to propose some guidelines “Towards a New Christian Sexual Ethics in the Light of HIV/AIDS”, and take into consideration various aspects of an African context. Next to upholding the positive value of our sexuality as part of God's good creation, we have to empower women to determine for themselves if, when, how and with whom they want to have sexual contact. We have to emphasise values like intimacy, love, commitment and responsibility, and we should discourage casual sex and prostitution. We may also have to reconsider the relationship between sexual relationships and activities and marriage. While confirming marriage as the ideal context of sexual relationships and activities, we may encourage people to practice their sexuality only within long‐term permanent relationships that should be characterised by the principles stated above. However, since we know that humans are not perfect, we have to reckon with people who are either unwilling or unable to follow the proposed guidelines, and at this point we, as churches and Christians, cannot avoid the discussion about condoms. According to my point of view, there is no alternative than to advise those unwilling or unable people always to consistently and correctly use condoms, while at the same tune we should encourage them to change their behaviour. One of the greatest problems to introducing the proposed guidelines is certainly the widespread difficulty there is to talk about sexual matters. This is something that we have to overcome in order to save people from dying, and to lead them into real loving relationships.""}"

Design and operation of the cryogenic system are described and its performance is demonstrated in a 1.5T clinical MRI scanner with images of a water phantom and a sheep intervertebral disc specimen.

This paper discusses a method of selecting variant groups to be reviewed for LGR (Label Generation Rule) of Internet Top-Level Hanja Domain. The most difficult problem in setting up LGR of Internet Top-Level Hanja Domain is how to treat Hanja variants. If domains containing variants (e.g.: 東海國) are directed to different addresses, confusion will arise. Therefore, it is desirable that such domains are directed to the same address. Since variant groups of Korea and China are not same, we need to unify variant groups of Korea and China. In the process of reviewing 3093 Chinese variant groups, the author found that Korea does not need to review Chinese variant groups which include no or just one Korean Hanja character. Korea only need to review Chinese variant groups which include two or more Korean Hanja characters. By doing so, the author could reduce the number of Chinese variant groups to be reviewed by Korea from 3093 to 303, which is only one-tenth of the original number of Chinese variant groups. After Korea finishes reviewing 303 Chinese variant groups selected according to the method suggested in this paper, the job of setting up LGR of Internet Top-Level Hanja domain will be accelerated by negotiating with China.""}"

As these measures are not computed within a fixed time horizon, they are flexible enough to capture subordinate, time-dependent processes that could drive market under- or overreaction.

Following brain injury, glia quickly respond by cleaning up neuronal and synaptic debris. In addition to their role as the cleaning cell of the brain, recent research has shown that during development, glia also shape and fine-tune neural connections by eliminating weak synapses fated for removal. However, whether glial cells also continue to remodel synaptic architecture in the adult brain is unclear. Moreover, synaptic pruning and loss are early hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but whether glial cells play a role in this pathophysiology remains mysterious. We will investigate the role of glial cells in AD-related synaptic loss using a Drosophila melanogaster model of AD. First, we will establish when synaptic loss occurs in AD model flies. Subsequently, we will explore the role of the glial engulfment receptor Draper, which is essential for glial clearance of neuronal debris after injury, and evaluate its effect on synaptic loss in the AD fly model. For these studies, we will use immunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques, as well as the power of Drosophila genetics. Through this project, we hope to 1) determine similarities and differences between the Drosophila AD model and human disease, 2) identify glial signals that may contribute to synaptic loss in this model and 3) identify molecular targets, which can potentially be manipulated to prevent or delay the first signs of AD.""}"

The in vivo role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in the development of glomerular injury is poorly understood. In the present study, glomerular MAPK activities, including extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNK), and transcriptional factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1) were examined in glomerular injury of salt-induced hypertensive rats. Six-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-S) and salt-resistant (Dahl-R) rats were maintained on a high-salt (8.0% NaCl) diet for 1, 5, and 10 wk. In Dahl-S rats, as shown by in-gel kinase assay, an increase in BP by a high-salt diet was followed by chronic activation of glomerular ERK and JNK, which continued until 10 wk after a high-salt diet. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the protein expression of glomerular ERK and JNK in Dahl-S rats fed a high-salt diet. As determined by gel-mobility shift assay, ERK and JNK activations were associated with an increase in glomerular AP-1 DNA binding activity. On the other hand, in Dahl-R rats fed a high-salt diet, BP remained normal throughout the experiments. However, glomerular ERK and JNK activities and AP-1 DNA binding activity in Dahl-R rats were not affected by 1 or 5 wk of a high-salt diet, but significantly increased by 10 wk of treatment with a high-salt diet, indicating that chronic sodium overload itself stimulated glomerular ERK and JNK and AP-1 activities. These kinase activations in both Dahl-S and Dahl-R rats were accompanied by an increase in urinary protein excretion and renal growth. These observations provide the first evidence that salt-sensitive hypertension causes chronic activation of glomerular ERK and JNK, probably leading to the activation of AP-1.

It argues that the Councils persistent dysfunction stems less from its membership structure than from the strategic misuse of veto power by its five permanent members (P5). Through legal interpretation, institutional analysis, and comparative case studies, the paper demonstrates that the veto has evolved from a collective safeguard into a political instrument that obstructs accountability and impedes humanitarian responses. Drawing on Articles 27(3), 31, 34, and 35 of the UN Charter, the study clarifies common misconceptions about membership inclusivity and shows that procedural participation is already available without structural expansion. It critically evaluates the limitations of expanding permanent membership and instead proposes institutional reforms that do not require Charter amendments. These include strengthening General Assembly oversight under Resolution 76/262, establishing a Veto Accountability Index, and restricting veto use in mass atrocity contexts. This paper ultimately contends that targeted, non-Charter-based reforms are not only more politically feasible but also essential to restoring the UNSCs credibility and effectiveness in a rapidly evolving global order.""}"

Data acquisition systems used for petroleum exploration record 96 or more channels in a linear array, and thus obtain a virtually unaliased representation of the wavefield. The data contains reflections from all angles of incidence, including postcritical angles, all normal modes, leaky modes, and head waves. A key tool in dealing with this kind of data is the Radon transform, which transforms the data set into a plane-wave representation. A raw data set u(x,t) is transformed into v(p,τ), where p, which parameterizes the plane waves, is the x component of slowness, and τ is a reduced (intercept) time. The ensemble of plane-wave seismograms is the basis for inversion of the data to obtain a one-dimensional velocity/impedance model. Modeling the lossy elastic transient plane-wave response is easily done by one of the modifications of the Thomson-Haskell matrix method. The algorithm can be vectorized to run very rapidly on a machine with an array processor. The object of the inversion is to obtain a model whose plane-wave decomposition agrees exactly with that of the observed wavefield. In the absence of noise, one plane-wave seismogram suffices to determine the model. An ensemble for a range of wave parameters overdetermines the model. In the presence of noise, the problem has the character of an ill-posed, overdetermined least squares problem. In order to carry through the solution by means of least squares, it is necessary to go through a construction procedure to make the trial model linearly close to the correct one in some parameter subspace. Several construction procedures proceed by stripping from the top down, although none have been reduced to a fully automatic alogrithm, and require some human intervention in the iterations.""}"

While the tenant screening industry has spent decades amassing eviction data to facilitate the blocklisting of tenants with prior eviction records and thereby reifying racial capitalist geographies, housing organizers today rely on some of this same data to illuminate evictor networks and organize anti‐eviction campaigns. This has been particularly important in the wake of corporate landlordism in which evictions are executed through opaque shell companies. Tenant‐made tools attempt to undo this uneven landscape in which landlords own troves of data about tenants, but in which tenants don't even know their own landlords’ names. While opening up all eviction data to the public might appear to be an antidote, doing so can also provide screening companies with even more data to use in blocklisting. In my examination of this conjuncture, I forge the analytic of dis/possessory data politics to map out the violence of tenant screening data predation while also problematizing the technoliberal impulse to open up all eviction data. Yet dis/possessory data politics also attest to care and coalition work marked by practices of possession beyond logics of theft, banishment and techno solutionism.""}"

Reversal of antibiotic resistance in Gram‐positive bacteria by the antihistaminic azelastine. APMIS 2012; 120: 215–20. Antibiotic resistance represents a serious problem that complicates microbial infection. The use of ‘helper compounds’ capable of enhancing the antimicrobial activity of antibiotics is being investigated. Azelastine, a new generation antihistaminic, possesses certain antibacterial activity and is capable of inducing alteration in the bacterial membrane permeability. Hence, we hypothesized that it could reverse resistance to antibiotics. Azelastine significantly increased the antibacterial activity of eight antibiotics belonging to five different classes (β‐lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines) against nine Gram‐positive clinical isolates: five Staphylococcus aureus , two Staphylococcus epidermidis and two Enterococcus faecium , seven of which were multi‐drug resistant, reversing their resistance to the tested antibiotics. The synergistic effects of azelastine with the studied antibiotics increased with raising the pH from 5 to 8. Antibiotics did not affect the ability of azelastine to alter the permeability of a liposomal artificial membrane model, an effect thought to be critical for the interaction with antibiotics. The findings of this study present azelastine as a potential ‘helper compound’ that could reverse the resistance of multi‐drug resistant Gram‐positive clinical isolates to antibiotics.""}"

With the flourishing of Cape No.7 which is released in 2008, Taiwanese films have started reaching international audiences, and the subtitles between multi-linguistic Taiwanese and English have thus become particularly important. In Taiwan, the multilingualism can no longer be ignored. The code-mixing, colloquialism, idioms, cultural-related puns and pop-songs pose the challenge to audiovisual translators, along with certain restrictions which operate in subtitling. \nTaking Seven Days in Heaven (父後七日) as a case study, this paper will examine the effects of English subtitles on Taiwanese film, and discuss the difficulties associated with culture-related untranslatability in translation. Because of the time and space, subtitle translation is a triggering problem (Diaz, 2007; Egoyan & Balfour, 2004 ; Gambier, 1997; Gottlieb, 1994 ; Yang, 2008). In order to grasp the insight of audio-visual translation, the data of the specifically-designed questionnaire, completed by 210 students from I-Shou University in Taiwan, will be analyzed, and with the support of translation theories, particular translation strategies will be provided. The translation of subtitle attempts inevitably to bridge the cultural and linguistic gaps. Seeing from this perspective, translation theories and views, such as domestification and foreignization, equivalence, interlinguistic translation, semiotics, polysystem, and descriptive translation, will be further explored, while searching for the solutions to subtitle translation with the cultural bound topics. The purpose of this study is to investigate how English subtitles cater the need of the minority language - Taiwanese. According to Venuti’s (1995) translation theory, it is essential to make a decision of applying domestification or foreignization to help the audience comprehend the movie immediately. Is subtitle translation the continuing life of the movie as Benjamin (1923) proposed? Moreover, which strategy can fulfill the communicative function? And to which level? The issues of rewriting, invisibility of the subtitlers and the continuing life of the source text will be discussed to support our strategic process, designed on purpose for catching the spirit of subtitle translation and for fulfilling its semantic and cultural functions.""}"

Mission statements and strategic objectives are often created in the hope that they can help push the organization toward some desired destination. Every person and every organization needs to have a clear destination for their group or organization, but it will require finding better vehicles than simple mission statements. Successful organizations should probably spend 90 percent of their time keeping people focused and 10 percent figuring out how to get there. Ineffective organizations tend to spend 90 percent of their time making rules, regulations, and procedures. Asking good questions is a fine start, but it also takes hard work and continual feedback; otherwise, you end up with a lifeless mission statement. It may not be essential for the entire group to think as one or to reach a complete agreement or singularity about what they are supposed to be about, but the process of continually monitoring and evolving this process is essential.""}"

However, responses of trees to minor and local damage imposed by small arthropod herbivores, especially by those mining or skeletonising individual leaves, remain poorly understood. We studied the delayed effects of injuries by several leafmining and leafrolling insects on the performance of downy birch shoots. Insect feeding did not affect survival of shoots or survival of individual axillary buds in long shoots. In the year following the damage, shoots produced an average of 13.8% more biomass than undamaged shoots of the same tree. The magnitude of this effect increased with an increase in the leaf area injured during the previous year, but it did not differ among four localities in subarctic and boreo‐nemoral forests, between herbivore feeding guilds, or among herbivores imposing damage in early, mid and late summer. We also found that herbivores attacked the next‐year foliage produced by damaged shoots less frequently than they attacked the next‐year foliage produced by undamaged shoots of the same tree. Thus, our study demonstrated delayed local compensatory growth and increased antiherbivore defence in downy birch shoots following local damage by insect feeding. We suggest that this pattern reflects evolutionary adaptations of plants to permanently acting minor, dispersed and spatially unpredictable damage imposed by endemic herbivory. Local responses are less costly and represent a more sustainable strategy to maintain plant fitness under low levels of herbivory than constitutive resistance or systemic responses.""}"

In order to speak freely about love – either sentimental or sexual – and to counter the effects of censorship, novelists soon started to develop more sophisticated narrative and enunciative strategies, allowing them to deny authorial responsibility while leaving textual traces which the reader could track down.

Although the mobile phone is currently one of the most pervasive communication technologies, only a few studies have approached it from a gender perspective and even fewer from a feminist viewpoint. Studies about gender and mobile phones can be divided into two categories: studies centred on the differences between men and women, and those that offer a more nuanced account of gender practices. The stories of women presented in the chapter illustrate the multiplicity of the facets of their emerging relationship with mobile phones, and how their life stories intersect with different uses of technology and the mobile phone in particular. The chapter reveals that in Portugal, the mobile phone has different roles and affordances throughout women's life courses.""}"

The first section is devoted to the nature of science and God. Whereas Gregory thinks science is based on metaphysical naturalism with a methodological corollary of critical‐realist empiricism, I see critical, empiricist methodology as basic, and naturalism as a consequence. Gregory's exposition of his apophatic theology, in which univocity is eschewed, illustrates the fissure between religious and scientific worldviews—no matter which basic scientific theory one subscribes to. The second section is allotted to miracles. As I do, Gregory thinks no miracle occurred on Fox Lakes in 1652, but he restricts himself to understanding the actors and explaining change over time, and refuses to explain past or contemporary actions and events. Marc Bloch, in his book The Royal Touch: Sacred Monarchy and Scrofula in England and France , is willing to go much further than Gregory. Using his superior medical knowledge to substitute his own explanation of the phenomenon for that of the actors, Bloch dismisses the actors’ beliefs that they or others had been miraculously cured, and explains that they believed they saw miraculous healing because they were expecting to see it. In the third section, on historical explanation, I rephrase the question whether historians can accommodate both believers in God and naturalist scientists, asking whether God, acting miraculously or not, can be part of the ideal explanatory text. I reply in the negative, and explicate how the concept of a plural subject suggests how scientists can also be believers. This approach may be compatible with two options presented by Peter Lipton for resolving the tension between religion and science. The first is to see the truth claims of religious texts as untranslatable into scientific language (and vice versa ); the other is to immerse oneself in religious texts by accepting them as a guide but not believing in their truth claims when these contradict science.""}"

The global prevalence of Th2 allergic diseases has increased the need for a deeper understanding of their pathophysiology. Several associations have been identified between genetic variants in the genes encoding components of the complement system and allergic disease. Moreover, levels of several complement proteins are elevated in patients with allergy. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the complement system plays a critical role in the development of these diseases across barrier sites. While site-specific differences exist in the complement components involved, key pathways, particularly C3 and C5, are prominent across the skin, gut, and lung.""}"

Oil was extracted using soxhlet method. UV-visible spectrophotometer was used for nutritional and antinutritinal analyses; while gas chromatography and titrimetry were used to analyse the fatty acid profile and physicochemical properties of the seed oil respectively. Results: Results revealed that the seeds recorded more concentrated energy (596.28 Kcal/100g) than the pulps (403.42 Kcal/100g). Total phenolic (133.70 ± 0.15 mg/100g), tannin (77.90 ± 0.01 mg/100g), oxalate (15.01 ± 0.01 mg/100g) and phytic acid (2.81 ± 0.06 mg/100g) contents were displayed by the pulp and 29.70 ± 0.25, 18.00 ± 0.07, 20.92 ± 0.07 and 1.88 ± 0.01 mg/100g, respectively for seeds. The abundant minerals in the pulp were K, Ca, Na, and P, those in the seeds were Mg, K, P and Fe. The Acid value, Saponification value, Iodine value, Peroxide value and P-anisdine value of the seed oil were 2.24 ± 1.16 mgKOH/g, 222.2 ± 3.11 mgKOH/g, 78.50 ± 0.54 gI2/100g, 5.50 ± 0.71 mEq/kg and 3.65 ± 0.23, respectively. Fatty acid profiling showed 66.68% unsaturated fatty acids of which 19.86% and 9.81% were linoleic and linolenic, respectively and 33.32% saturated.

The program has grown from a desire within the college to explore meaningfully the diversity associated with its social location in downtown Toronto and to participate responsibly in the important work of inter-religious dialogue. The story of the program's development is placed within an analysis of at least three areas offering challenges to the effort. Faculty members face significant obstacles in reshaping a curriculum within theological education that can address contemporary contexts of both Church and culture in a manner that includes intentional engagement with religious diversity. Within Christian history, a wide variety of methodological approaches have been developed to understand the nature of religious diversity in relation to Christianity. Each offers its own challenges to attempts to shape responsible encounters between Christianity and other world religions. Finally, the rich diversity within Islam existing within the social context of Toronto creates interesting challenges for a program in Muslim Studies intending to take expressions of religious faith seriously. The essay also examines wide-ranging rationales for why a Christian theological school would attempt to face these challenges in order to begin a program designed to provide educational opportunities for Muslims. In the final pages, the three major components of the program are described.""}"

It argues for the need to revise the Constitution of the United States in reference to the cutting-edge human rights norms that find expression not only in the classics of the human rights canon. When placed in the trajectory of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment thought, the US Constitution appears as both a forerunner and a laggard in its stance on human rights. The chapter points to the widespread veneration of the \""Founding Fathers\"" and the concomitant fetishization of the constitution—both of which figure prominently in the political culture of the United States—as factors that inhibit discussion of comprehensive constitutional reform.""}"

The powder material itself includes several variables such as basic material properties and characteristics, powder particle size and distribution, and shape of particles. The selection of particle size is done mainly by availability of the feedstock material, and by practical knowledge and experience. Coating powders are in many cases available in different sizes, which allows optimisation and tailoring of laser clad structures and properties, depending on needs for applications. However, useful theoretical knowledge with good applicability to real life solutions is very limited. The main purpose of the investigation was to establish powder selection criteria for industrial laser cladding, by gathering practical knowledge through experimental research. The focus of the study is to clarify the effect of powder particle size range and distribution on powder catchment efficiency and surface quality. The cladding powder used in the work was a cobalt based hardfacing alloy Stellite 21 with several particle size ranges and distributions, from different powder manufacturers.""}"

Pericardial effusion was serous in 5 patients, sero-sanguineous in 3, sanguineous in 3, and purulent in one; it was most frequently caused by a postpericardiotomy syndrome (7 cases). A single pericardiocentesis was curative in 6 instances, while repeat procedures were required in 2 because of recurrence.

Three patients died within one month from the initial operation; no recurrences have been noted so far in the long-term survivors. According to the results of the present investigation, early clinical recognition is considered the clue to a successful outcome. Sole pericardiocentesis is followed by immediate improvement of the patient's state, and is often curative, but recurrences may require other maneuvers for further fluid evacuation.

The photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area and the rate of growth of the pods were similar for all branches. Since the leaf area of one branch was three times the leaf area of the other branch in the uneven treatment, long distance translocation from one branch to the other was necessary to support the growth of the seeds. The rate of abortion of the seeds appeared to be much less on the branches having fewer pods in the uneven treatment. The final yield (g/m 2 ) for each of the individual branches of both treatments was the same, indicating that the uptake of carbohydrate by the seeds was not limited by resistance to long distance translocation.""}"

Mapping revealed nine QTL, including new QTL and a new allele for the q locus, controlling wheat spike morphometric traits. To identify loci controlling spike morphometric traits, namely spike length (SL), internode length (IL), node number per spike (NPS), and node density (ND), we studied 146 Recombinant Inbred Lines of tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) derived from standard spike and spike-branching mutant parents. Phenotypic analyses of spike morphometric traits showed low genetic coefficients of variation, resulting in high heritabilities. The phenotypic correlation between NPS with growing degree days (GDD) suggested the importance of GDD in the determination of node number in wheat. The major effect QTL for GDD or heading date was mapped to chromosome 7BS carrying the flowering time gene, Vrn3-B1. Mapping also identified nine QTL controlling spike morphometric traits. Most of these loci controlled more than a single trait, suggesting a close genetic interrelationship among spike morphometric traits. For example, this study identified a new QTL, QND.ipk-4AL, controlling ND (up to 17.6% of the phenotypic variance), IL (up to 11% of the phenotypic variance), and SL (up to 20.8% of the phenotypic variance). Similarly, the major effect QTL for IL was mapped to the q locus. Sequencing of the Q/q gene further revealed a new q allele, q<sup>del</sup>-5A, in spike-branching accessions possessing a six base pair deletion close to the miR172 target site. The identification of q<sup>del</sup>-5A suggested that the spike-branching tetraploid wheats are double mutants for the spikelet meristem (SM) identity gene, i.e., branched head<sup>t</sup> (TtBH<sup>t</sup>), and the q gene, which is believed to be involved in the SM indeterminacy complex in wheat.""}"

However, the presence of urinary sample bacteria in individuals without urinary symptoms (referred to as asymptomatic bacteriuria) is common especially in older people and in pregnant individuals. Furthermore, the discovery of an indigenous urinary microbiome (urobiome) in healthy humans throughout life from shortly after birth to death conflicts with the long-standing notion that urine derived from sterile filtered blood should be sterile above the urethral sphincter. Polymicrobial infections clash with Koch’s postulates that a single pathogen is causal for disease. In this review, we will discuss current standards of contamination, how to reconcile the sterility of urine with the existence of the urobiome, a history of polymicrobial infections, and why re-examining current practices is essential for the practice of medicine, improving quality of life, and potentially saving lives.""}"

Design/methodology/approach – Major export barriers perceived by SMEs in Turkey are identified and, subsequently, the relationship between export barriers and export performance are examined. A web‐based questionnaire method was conducted among 2,000 SMEs that listed export associations with 7.25 percent response rate. The empirical analysis was conducted in two phases. The first step was to perform an exploratory factor analysis to 20 export barriers. The second step was to run a structural equation model to determine which barrier groups have a greater effect on perceived export performance. Findings – The findings suggest that procedural barriers and competition in foreign markets have the most effective impact on export performance. Both structures have negative effects as expected. In other words, as the procedural and competition barriers decrease, export performance also increases. Research limitations/implications – First of all, not all export barriers that might affect export performance were examined. Another limitation is that, the data obtained related to a very specific period. Export performance was measured by only subjective method with Likert scale. In the context of future research, export barriers of the Turkish exporters in relation to individual countries of origin should be investigated. Practical implications – The analysis of exporting problems on the basis of firm differences between domestic and foreign markets, procedural barriers, internal inefficiency barriers, competition and governmental barriers can provide both corporate and public policy makers with valuable guidelines for the formulation of suitable export marketing strategies and national export assistance programs respectively Originality/value – This study generally confirms the literature, but comes to some original further conclusions, based on export barriers of Turkish exporters.""}"

Gradients in these two fields are the driving forces that move the immiscible fluids around. The fluids are characterized by two seepage velocity fields, one for each fluid. Following Hansen et al. (Transport in Porous Media, 125, 565 (2018)), we construct a two-way transformation between the velocity couple consisting of the seepage velocity of each fluid, to a velocity couple consisting of the average seepage velocity of both fluids and a new velocity parameter, the co-moving velocity. The co-moving velocity is related but not equal to velocity difference between the two immiscible fluids. The two-way mapping, the mass conservation equation and the constitutive equations for the average seepage velocity and the co-moving velocity form a closed set of equations that determine the flow. There is growing experimental, computational and theoretical evidence that constitutive equation for the average seepage velocity has the form of a power law in the pressure gradient over a wide range of capillary numbers. Through the transformation between the two velocity couples, this constitutive equation may be taken directly into account in the equations describing the flow of each fluid. This is, e.g., not possible using relative permeability theory. By reverse engineering relative permeability data from the literature, we construct the constitutive equation for the co-moving velocity. We also calculate the co-moving constitutive equation using a dynamic pore network model over a wide range of parameters, from where the flow is viscosity dominated to where the capillary and viscous forces compete. Both the relative permeability data from the literature and the dynamic pore network model give the same very simple functional form for the constitutive equation over the whole range of parameters.""}"

The aim of this study was to see whether young men and women differed in the time and skeletal region of peak bone density. We also investigated the influence of diet and physical activity on bone mass. The study group included 51 male and 75 female students aged 19 to 25 years. Bone mineral density was measured for the spine, total femur, and the distal third of the radius using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary data were obtained using a specially designed semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Bone mineral density (BMD; g cm -2 ) was higher in boys than in girls at all measured sites, while bone mineral apparent density (BMAD; g cm -3 ) was higher in girls. Age negatively correlated with bone mineral density in all measured sites except in the boys' spine. Sodium, protein, and fibres were nutrients that significantly correlated with bone mineral density. The study suggests that boys achieve peak bone density later than girls, and that this delay is the most prominent in the spine. In our study group, this difference could not be explained by different nutrition or the level of physical activity.""}"

That’s about as far back as what we would call Greek art goes, so the Gorgon is indeed one of the oldest figures in Greek art. As with all images, it has undergone changes through the years, but most of the important features held constant through classical times. In 1896 Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher analyzed the Gorgon in art, and his description of its evolution is still the standard one. According to Roscher, the development of the Gorgon can be divided into three stages. The oldest, the Archaic Gorgon, runs from about the eighth century B.C.E. through about the fifth. The Gorgons that appear in “The Shield of Hercules” are perfect examples of Archaic Gorgons. They have wide-open, staring eyes and a broad grinning or snarling mouth filled with prominent teeth, usually with both upper and lower fangs. Despite the toothy display, there is a prominent, painfully protruding tongue. The extreme facial expression usually produces strongly drawn lines at the edges of the mouth and on the forehead.""}"

A bottom- up approach to state broadband policy has three major advantages. First, it is a conservative policy response in an economic arena in which the appropriate role of the public sector is highly contested and in which private sector deployment is proceeding rapidly, even as gaps in service in rural and poorer communities remain. Second, it acknowledges the extraordinary practical difficulty of identifying and addressing all broadband infrastructure and service gaps at any point in time, given data limitations and the rapid pace at which technologies, services and the telecommunications industry itself are evolving. Third, it facilitates the design of solutions that are unique to the local conditions in places where gaps exist and where local commitment to policy action is clearly demonstrated.""}"

Το γονίδιο Cyld κωδικοποιεί για ένα ένζυμο αποουβικιτίνωσης, τη CYLD, η οποία επιτελεί ανοσορυθμιστική λειτουργία. Στην παρούσα ερευνητική εργασία αξιολογήθηκε ο ρόλος του γονιδίου Cyld στην ανάπτυξη των Τ λεμφοκυττάρων. Για να επιτευχθεί αυτό δημιουργήθηκε ένας ποντικός (Cyld Δ9) ο οποίος έφερε μια μετάλλαξη στο γονίδιο Cyld που περιοριζόταν αποκλειστικά στα θυμοκύτταρα. Η μετάλλαξη αυτή προκαλεί θραύση στο καρβοξυτελικό τμήμα της πρωτεΐνης και προσομοιάζει τις καταλυτικά ανενεργές μεταλλάξεις οι οποίες παρατηρούνται στον άνθρωπο. Οι μεταλλαγμένοι ποντικοί εμφάνιζαν δραματική μείωση των απλά θετικών SP θυμοκυττάρων και απώλεια των περιφερικών Τ κυττάρων. Η ανάλυση πολυκλωνικών καθώς και περιοριζόμενων από διαγονιδιακούς TCR υποδοχείς θυμοκυττάρων που έφεραν τη μετάλλαξη αποκάλυψε σημαντικό πρόβλημα στη διαδικασία της θετικής επιλογής καθώς και αυξημένη απόπτωση στο στάδιο των διπλά θετικών DP θυμοκυττάρων. Ιδιαίτερο ενδιαφέρον παρουσιάζει το γεγονός πώς στο πλαίσιο διαγονιδιακών TCR που αναγνωρίζουν το αντιγόνο που παρουσιάζεται από μόρια τάξης Ι και ΙΙ, η έλλεψη λειτουργικής CYLD προκάλεσε μαζική απαλοιφή των θυμοκυττάρων υπό συνθήκες που θα έπρεπε να έχουν επιλεγεί θετικά. Το γεγονός αυτό υποδηλώνει πρόβλημα στη διαδικασία της θετικής επιλογής. Βιοχημική ανάλυση αποκάλυψε ότι τα Cyld Δ9 θυμοκύτταρα εμφάνιζαν μη φυσιολογική, ιδιαίτερα υψηλή ενεργοποίηση τόσο του μεταγραφικού παράγοντα NF-κΒ αλλά και των JNK μορίων. Αξιοσημείωτα, η ανενεργοποίηση του NEMO αποκατέστησε πλήρως τα επίπεδα ενεργοποίησης του NF-κΒ διασώζοντας τα προβλήματα ανάπτυξης και επιβίωσης που παρατηρήθηκαν. Συνολικά, τα αποτελέσματα αυτά ταυτοποίησαν το θεμελιώδη ρόλο της λειτουργικής CYLD στην εγκαθίδρυση του κατάλληλου ορίου ενεργοποίησης για την επιλογή των θυμοκυττάρων κατά τρόπο που εξαρτάται από το NEMO. Προκειμένου να διαλευκανθεί η βιολογική λειτουργία της CYLD σε πληθυσμούς μακροφάγων δημιουργήθηκε ένας ποντικός (Cyld Δ9) ο οποίος έφερε την μετάλλαξη στο γονίδιο Cyld που προαναφέρθηκε και που περιοριζόταν αποκλειστικά στα κύτταρα της μυελοειδούς σειράς. Οι ποντικοί αυτοί δεν εμφάνιζαν αιμοποιητικά προβλήματα, αλλά ήταν περισσότερο ανθεκτικοί στο επαγόμενο από LPS ενδοτοξικό σοκ. Επιπρόσθετα, όταν απουσίαζε η λειτουργική CYLD τα μακροφάγα δε μπορούσαν να στρατολογηθούν στο σημείο της φλεγμονής σε ένα in vivo μοντέλο ασηπτικής περιτονίτιδας. Τέλος, παρατηρήθηκε μειωμένη ικανότητα αναδιοργάνωσης των μικροσωληνίσκων και μεταναστευτικής ικανότητας σε Cyld Δ9 εμβρυικούς ινοβλάστες όταν είχαν υποστεί κατεργασία με το χημικό παράγοντα nocodazole. Συνολικά, τα αποτελέσματα αυτά αναδεικνύουν τη CYLD σε σημαντικό μόριο που ελέγχει την κυτταρική μετανάστευση διαφορετικών κυττάρων, γεγονός που σχετίζεται με την ικανότητα της να αλληλεπιδρά με μικροσωληνίσκους.""}"

Liver being a vital organ performs more than hundreds regulatory functions of the body. Present study investigates the modulation of molecular pathways that are responsible for liver damage triggered by heat stress. Male Sprague dawley rats were exposed to heat stress (45 °C) in heat simulation chamber till core temperature reaches 40 °C and 42 °C in 25 and 42 min respectively. For in-depth evaluation of liver functions during severe heat stress, hepatic transcriptome and proteome were analysed by microarray and two dimensional gel electrophoresis respectively. Results revealed major alterations in redox status, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis related pathways. Data of molecular pathway analysis demonstrate that nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) mediated oxidative stress response and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) regulated inflammatory pathways were upregulated in severe heat stressed liver. Expression levels of downstream molecules of above pathways such as heat shock protein 90AB 1, peroxiredoxin 5, Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2, heme-oxygenase 1, apolipoprotein 1 and interleukin 10 were examined and result suggested the upregulation of these genes modulates the NRF-2 and MIF regulated pathways in heat stressed liver. Irregularity in molecular signalling networks lead to mitochondrial dysfunction indicated by upregulation of ATP synthase β and peroxiredoxin 1 along with decreased levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and enhanced activity of cytochrome c in liver mitochondria. Thus, current study demonstrated heat induced alterations in key liver functions were regulated by NRF-2 and MIF pathways.""}"

I believe that they are in important ways interrelated.

The two plays are both concerned with extremes but they also share a special harsh quality, and it is this harshness which sets them apart; it permeates the play-world, it is apparent throughout, in the cultural rules as much as in manners and personal relationships; and it is kin to the harshness which is the key element, the special mark of injustice, which creates the bleak vision of King Lear.""}"

A decrease in particle size distribution from 18.55 nm to 16.30 nm was observed, which means a reduction in agglomeration and increased dispersibility. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) observations showed that the saturation magnetization of Fe3O4 particles modified with OA decreased from 47.71 emu/g to 45.90 emu/g at Fe3O4-OA(0.75) and decreased again to 42.29 emu/g at Fe3O4-OA(1.25). But they all show soft ferromagnetic properties with very low coercivity, making them suitable for Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor applications. A series of concentrations in ethanol solution were performed to evaluate the detection sensitivity of GMR for these pure and oleic acid-modified Fe3O4 samples. Concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 mg/ml were integrated at 2 μL each onto the surface of the GMR chip. A decrease in sensitivity was observed due to the change in saturation. Pure Fe3O4 with a sensitivity of 5.07 mV (mg/ml) decreased to 4.49 mV (mg/ml) and 3.35 mV (mg/ml) after oleic acid coating.

Biopsies were collected from the skin of 12 alpacas from the Pacomarca Experimental Fund, located at Puno - Peru. The samples were weighed and fixed in 10% aqueous formalin solution for histological procedures. The histological sections were stained with Hematoxylin eosin, Picrossirius red and Masson Trichromic and immunostained for types I, III and IV collagen and S100. Results: The derma presented sebaceous and sweat glands, as well as follicular groups with primary and secondary hair follicles. Each follicle had a hair called fiber, some with medulla and some without, but both surrounded by cortex and cuticle. The skin presented similar immunostaining for type I, II and IV and S100. Collagen III was detected only in the derma. The total volume of the skin, derma, follicular groups and sebaceous and sweat glands was estimated by stereology for the three body regions for both Huacaya and Suri alpacas. The total volume of skin (Vref) and total volume of follicular groups (VGF) were different for body regions. Femoral region showed higher values for VGF. Colour and breed were also different for Vref and total volume of derma (VD). Conclusion: Comparing the two breeds the femoral region presented higher fiber production.

The eddy covariance technique was used to obtain the CO2 flux, water and energy flux at the level of alpine ecosystem. The data were post-processed by REddyProc and Random Forest (RF), and the variation characteristics of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) at different time scales and different underlying surfaces were analyzed, so as to accurately evaluate and compare the carbon budget under different underlying surfaces. The influence mechanism of meteorological factors on CO2 flux of alpine meadow and alpine desert grassland was explored, which provided reference and data support for the research on carbon and water cycle of alpine meadow and alpine desert grassland in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results showed that:1) Maqin alpine meadow mainly absorbed carbon sink from June to July, and the absorption peak appeared between 11:00 and 12:00 (Beijing, the same below). However, in March, April, May and August, the main emission was carbon source, and the emission peak appeared between 21:00 and 23:00. The alpine desert of Tuotuo Rivers was mainly absorbed from March to August, showing net carbon sink, and the absorption peak appeared between 13:00 and 14:00; around the whole growing season (March-August), the cumulative NEE of Maqin and Tuotuo Rivers were 79.50 g C/m2 and 79.24 g C/m2, respectively, showing carbon sink. 2). The correlation between carbon flux and meteorological factors was different in different scales and underlying surfaces. On the hourly scale, the importance of alpine meadow radiation (Rg) to carbon flux was the largest. Evapotranspiration (ET) in alpine desert steppe was the most important factor for carbon flux. On the daily scale, soil water content (Soil _VWC) was the most important factor for carbon flux in alpine meadow, while wind speed (WS) was the most important factor for carbon flux in alpine desert steppe. 3) Ecosystem Respiration (Reco) and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) were significantly restricted by total primary productivity (GPP), and 91% of the GPP contributed to Reco and 9% to NEE; in alpine desert steppe, 40% of the GPP contributed to Reco and 60% to NEE. 4) NEE was significantly correlated with ET, indicating that water condition was the most important factor controlling the changes of carbon and water budget in alpine meadow and alpine desert steppe. 5) Human activities intensified the impact of climate change and the susceptibility of carbon balance, and became the inducing factors of weak carbon sources in March, April, May and August in Maqin. 参考文献 相似文献 引证文献""}"

All the characteristic variables of coal mine gas emission are replaced by some characteristic variables with cumulative influence weight of 90%. And eight characteristic variables with high importance are selected as input variables of the model, including coal mining height, coal thickness, coal seam gas content, recovery rate, burial depth, daily progress, mining intensity and adjacent layers spacing. The test results show that the random forest regression model with all characteristic variables and some characteristic variables has good prediction performance. After selecting characteristic variables, the average absolute error of the model decreases from 022 m3/min to 021 m3/min, and the average relative error decreases from 355% to 347%.

Different situations have continued to shape young adults’ housing tenure decisions. However, very little research has been done to investigate the impact of some social capital drivers, such as neighbourhood integration and strength of parental intimacy, on housing tenure decisions in Britain. Design/methodology/approach This paper is carried out by tracking a sample of young adults in the British Household Panel Survey from 1991 to 2015 until they make tenure transition. Multinomial fixed-effects logistic regression of time to tenure transition was useful for the models, incorporating established economic and demographic drivers and with the inclusion of contextual social capital variables. Findings The inclusion of the number of years of parental home ownership experience tends to improve on previous path-dependency indicators of tenure transition. With additional years of parental home ownership experience, British young adults are more likely to remain or return to parental housing. Also, individuals that exchange better with their neighbours are less likely to switch tenure. On the other hand, regularity of contact with parents showed a positive relationship with home ownership or parental housing transitions. Originality/value To the best of the author’s knowledge, no study has explored the impact of the duration of socialisation in parental housing and also the impact of some other social capital drivers, such as neighbourhood integration and strength of parental intimacy, on housing tenure decisions among young adults. Hence, it is believed that the findings will further assist policymakers in understanding the dimensions and drivers of tenure shifts.""}"

This study devotes to understanding the neuronal correlates of alpha rhythm slowing associated with AD from the view of neurocomputation. Firstly, a modified computational model of thalamo-cortico-thalamic (TCT) circuitry is constructed by incorporating two important biologically plausible ingredients. One is the disinhibition property between different inhibitory interneurons in the cortical module. The other is the full relay function of thalamic relay nucleus (TCR) to the cortical module. Then, by decreasing synaptic connectivity parameters to mimic the neuropathological condition of synapse loss in AD, the correlation between neuronal synaptic behavior and abnormal alpha rhythm is simulated by means of power spectral analysis. The results indicate that these decreases of synaptic activity, i.e., not only the excitatory synaptic connections from TCR to fast inhibitory interneurons Cfte and from excitatory interneurons to pyramidal neurons Cpxe but also the inhibitory synaptic connections from fast inhibitory interneurons to slow inhibitory interneurons Clfi and from inhibitory interneurons to TCR Ctii, can significantly diminish the peak power density over the alpha band of the thalamic output, which implies that there is a slowing of alpha band. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism behind the alpha rhythmic changes is analyzed using nonlinear dynamical technique.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) play important regulatory roles in the development of atherosclerosis. An MMP:TIMP imbalance leads to inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and plaque formation. <b>Aims:</b> Our goal was to analyze the short- and long-term effects of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) on the serum levels of MMP and TIMP proteins (MMP1, -2, -3, -4, -8, -9, -10, -13, TIMP1, -2, -4) and correlate them with various physiological parameters. <b>Methods:</b> 7 MMPs and 3 TIMPs were measured longitudinally in the serum of 31 patients diagnosed with severe OSAS (apopnoe-hypopnoe index [AHI]:&gt; 30/h) on quantitative antibody microarrays. Data obtained at the time of diagnosis, at 2 and 6 months and 5 years after the start of CPAP treatment were compared statistically. <b>Results:</b> CPAP treatment resulted in the normalization of patients' AHI, ODI and Epworth scores already at 2 months (p &lt;0.001 vs. diagnosis), but the levels of neither MMPs and TIMPs nor their relative ratios were significantly altered. Sustained CPAP therapy kept sleep parameters in the normal range after 5 years. In contrast, MMP1, -2, -8, -9, -10, all TIMPs and the MMP9:TIMP1 ratio increased (p&lt;0.05) after 5 years compared to earlier time points. <b>Conclusions:</b> In severe OSAS, changes of serum MMP and TIMP levels show no correlation with CPAP induced changes of sleep parameters. Long term changes in MMP:TIMP ratios may affect the development of atherosclerosis in severe OSAS.""}"

Refusing the interpretation of racial laws as a temporary phase of Italian history completely alien to the country’s cultural context, the article underlines how 1938 fits into and can be reinserted into the general interpretation of the Institute of Roman Studies’ initiatives. Furthermore, it analyses the consequences of the racial legislation on the staff and collaborators employed by the Institute. The author shows that the racial laws represent an additional element of the attempt of some distinguished intellectuals to find a synthesis between the sacralisation of politics and the politicisation of religion through the myth of Rome. Spreading and trying to strengthen the national-roman version of racism, the author underlines that the Institute of Roman Studies was in the first line to shaping an interpretation that, influenced by the Catholic anti-modern thought, was no more moderate or less responsible for the persecution of the Jews than other more revolutionary positions inside the fascism. In fact, this interpretation made the concept of the Italian race even more acceptable in public opinion, strengthening and rooting it in the history and greatness of Italian civilisation throughout the centuries. Finally, the article stresses that the racial laws were a crucial moment of shaping the fascist anthropological revolution, totally supported by an Institute fully engaged in the middle of the battle for the nationalization of the masses fought by the regime and the Catholic Church between the wars""}"

The aim of this study was to develop a fully automated image updating system to address brain shift at the start of open cranial surgery and to evaluate its accuracy and efficiency. METHODS This study included patients undergoing open cranial procedures at a single center. Intraoperative stereovision (iSV) images of the surgical field were acquired as an easily integrated nondisruptive source of high-resolution image data on surgical surface deformation and were integrated with a computational model to compensate for volumetric brain shift after dural opening by updating the coregistered preoperative images. A Fast Segment Anything Model algorithm segmented the exposed cortical surface on iSV images automatically. Vessel and sulcus features were also segmented automatically from both iSV and pMR images and registered using a two-step registration method. Extracted nonrigid cortical displacements were assimilated by a finite element model to estimate whole-brain deformation. Updated MR (uMR) images were generated by deforming pMR by the resulting displacement field. A tracked stylus sampled the exposed cortical surface to provide independent measurements for error assessments. The uMR images were evaluated in terms of the misfit between model estimates and measured displacements, target registration error (TRE), and point-to-surface distance (PSD) relative to their pMR counterparts. RESULTS Fifteen patients (age range 45–85 years) who underwent open cranial procedures were included in the study. The overall accuracy of reconstructed iSV surfaces relative to stylus positions was 0.8 ± 0.7 mm. The overall mean misfit, TRE, and PSD of uMR images were 2.1 ± 1.2 mm, 1.9 ± 1.0 mm, and 1.6 ± 1.0 mm, respectively, compared with 6.5 ± 1.3 mm, 6.2 ± 1.2 mm, and 4.5 ± 1.2 mm for pMR images. Image updating was completed automatically without any user intervention in an overall mean of 3.9 ± 0.6 minutes. CONCLUSIONS Automatic image updating compensated for brain shift due to dural opening and achieved clinically acceptable accuracy and efficiency. The system required no user intervention or expertise and caused minimal interruptions to surgical flow, suggesting it has potential for future integration into open cranial procedures.""}"

We innovatively adopted the hazard ratio (HR), the most appropriate indicator, as a measure of the outcomes that fall under the category of time-to-event data.

Firstly, they are both committed to the ineluctable transience of living experience—experience that is always-already significant and felt as moving from and towards various relations.

For this evaluation, topography, geological setting, hydrology, and petrology of the Harrat basalts are the most important parameters. The basalts must have su cient thickness of at least 500 m of which at least 400 m must be saturated with groundwater in order to completely dissolve CO2 at the injection depth. The basalts must be reactive with dissolved CO2 and must have su cient matrix or fracture permeability. In addition, the basalts must be located near a xed industrial source of CO2, and there must be su cient supply of water for injection. All the volcanic elds in western and northern Saudi Arabia are evaluated in this study, amounting to 17 individual elds. The basalt elds were grouped in an older and younger generation, each with speci c geological characteristics. The basalts are reactive with CO2, because they are relatively unaltered. Field observations con rm that the basalts are su ciently permeable, particularly in tu s, agglomerates near vents, in distal lava ows along natural shrinkage joints and along vesicular margins of individual ows. The total thickness of basalt within lava elds was mapped using the digital elevation model by subtracting the base elevation from the surface elevation. The level of the groundwater table was estimated from Google Earth observations of the local topography and well data. Most elds did not have su cient basalt thickness and/or groundwater for the process. Harrat Rahat meets most of the requirements for 5 the CarbFix process, having su ciently thick basalts in three areas and an extensive groundwater aquifer. However, the maximum height of the groundwater aquifer in basalts is estimated to be 225 meters, which is less than optimal. This study concludes that 16 out of the 17 basalt elds in Saudi Arabia are not suitable for carbon mineralization by the CarbFix process, mainly because they are too thin and located higher than the local groundwater table. However, this pioneering study establishes a baseline for additional research in new technologies using CarbFix or other processes.""}"

The article discusses the concept of fonua as culture in order to understand Tongan ways of thinking and practice. As a concept, it frames and names the many worlds that are experienced by Tongan people. The central idea here is that the many worlds and experiences are intimately related in energy, spirit and life force. Two interrelated notions, namely tu‘ufonua (being indigenous) and nofofonua (residing permanently in another country), are further discussed from the perspective of the author, who is indigenous to Tonga but is currently a permanent resident in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Both notions are explored by the writer and demonstrate that they can provide insights into significant dimensions of the underpinnings of fonua. The article suggests that Tongan migrants to Aotearoa/New Zealand can develop their critical perspectives of their indigeneity more deeply in order to inform their new ‘stance’ in the new context. That is, they are residing in a fonua/land of which they are not indigenous but with the legal status of resident. The author's concluding suggestion is that the Tongan people who reside in Aotearoa/New Zealand could become better informed about their ‘place’ in both Aotearoa and Tonga when they draw upon the knowledge and culture of their indigenous land alongside their learning and education in Aotearoa/New Zealand. In this way, the Tongan people recreate ways of working together to put an end to the colonising and the marginalising thinking and practices confronted in our own country and the new country of residency. 2""}"

Using both quantitative and qualitative sources, I present a new interpretation of these momentous events that reveals the centrality of perceptions of fairness and ‘good usage’ to their causation, course, and legacy with implications for historiographies of labour relations and popular protest. I have analysed the evidence used in previous studies to support the interpretation that the mutinies were revolutionary in their intentions and concluded that this does not provide a credible case. For the first time, I have quantified the impact of the stagnation of sailors’ wages between 1653 and 1797 on their purchasing power and conclude that this was a, but not the, cause of mutiny. Through the study of mutineer writings, rhetoric, and behaviour, I argue that insult and hurt pride were key motivators of mutiny and that relative rather than absolute naval conditions were pivotal causes of dissatisfaction. I assert that complex social inversions were employed by mutineer leaders to create legitimacy and encourage obedience towards their regime while minimising the need for violence or coercion. The practical challenges inherent to daily life during mutiny are contended to have encouraged continuity and moderation on both sides. Far from a ‘terror’, the judicial response to the mutinies was, I conclude, both pragmatic and conciliatory, while also within precedent for naval justice and reflective of judicial practice in civil society. The public perceptions of the mutinies are found to have been hotly contested and rehabilitation of the navy had to wait for redemption provided by victory at sea. Frequent comparisons are drawn between naval practice and the wider attitudes and prevailing circumstances in British society on shore.""}"

In this context, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach has been proposed as a “common ground” in joint HTAs. However, GRADE has been primarily developed to support authors of clinical guidelines. Therefore, it is unclear whether HTA reports based on GRADE are compatible with the methods currently applied by European HTA organizations. Methods We contrasted IQWiG's methods paper and publications by the GRADE Working Group with regard to the following domains: 1) risk of bias (RoB) assessment 2) prerequisites for “greater benefit” (assuming that IQWiG's “greater benefit” corresponds to a GRADE assessment of at least low certainty and a small important effect) and 3) consideration of non-randomized studies (NRS). We present illustrative differences and highlight similarities. Results Overall, RoB assessments are very similar under both approaches. However, we identified several important differences. In case of very severe publication bias, IQWiG methods preclude drawing a conclusion, whereas GRADE requires only downgrading the certainty of evidence while still allowing for a conclusion on effect sizes. Secondly, IQWiG generally requires a statistically significant effect for a “greater benefit”, while GRADE does not (statistically non-significant effects would only necessitate downgrading the certainty of results for imprecision). Another difference is that in general, NRS are not included in IQWiG assessments when randomized studies (RS) are available and thus possible. In contrast, preliminary GRADE guidance recommends considering NRS in addition to RS when the RS evidence is of low or very low certainty. Conclusions While GRADE and IQWiG's method share some similarities, our exemplary analysis shows that there are some notable differences. Therefore, GRADE should not be used “out of the box” for European HTAs. To foster further discussion, more research (including a comprehensive comparison of methods and an analysis of resources for adaptation) is needed.""}"

It has recently been established that the number of genes encoding human mast cell tryptases is much larger than originally believed, but it is not clear how many of these genes are expressed. A recent report suggested that the transcript for at least one of these genes, originally named mMCP-7-like tryptase, is not expressed. To further address this question, we screened tissue-specific RNA samples by RT-PCR, using primers designed to match the putative exonic sequence of this gene. We successfully generated and cloned the correctly sized RT-PCR product from mRNA isolated from the human mast cell-I cell line. Two distinct clones were identified whose nucleotide sequence matched the published sequence of the mMCP-7-like I and mMCP-7-like II genes. Transcripts were detected in a wide variety of human tissues including lung, heart, stomach, spleen, skin, and colon. A polyclonal antipeptide Ab that specifically recognizes the translated product of this transcript was used to demonstrate its expression in mast cells that reside in the colon, lung, and inflamed synovium. A recombinant form of this protein expressed in bacterial cells was able to cleave a synthetic trypsin-sensitive substrate, d-Ile-Phe-Lys pNA. These results suggest that the range of functional tryptases is larger than previously recognized. For simplicity, we suggest that the gene, transcripts, and corresponding protein product be named δ tryptase.""}"

Acinetobacter baumannii frequently causes nosocomial infections, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). Multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii encodes multiple virulence factors that contribute to chronic diseases, as well as antibiotic resistance; among them is the capacity to colonize and produce Biofilm on biotic and abiotic surfaces that is the primary source of worry in hospital environments. The study assessed the role of antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation patterns caused by MDR A. baumannii between isolates from COVID-19 and respiratory-infected patients in Baghdad Medical City hospitals and Teaching laboratories. This study included isolating and identifying A. baumannii from the sputum samples of respiratory tract-infected patients. (some of them infected with COVID-19) . Diagnosis of isolates was done by conventional cultural, microscopical and biochemical methods and confirmed by API 20E and VITEK2 system. Investigation of the susceptibility profile of the isolates against 18 types of antibiotics was tested, and the determination of A. baumannii biofilm formation was recorded by qualitative and quantitative methods. Results showed that 36 bacterial isolates were identified as A. baumannii. Most isolates were resistant to antibiotics, including all penicillins and cephalosporins (including inhibitor combinations), fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, followed by carbapenems antibiotics. In contrast, all isolates were susceptible to colistin (94.4%), followed by minocycline (36.1%), and the proportions of MDR, XDR, and PDR were 19.4%, 77.8 %, and 2.8 %, respectively. All isolates of A. baumannii showed biofilm formation (100%) by Quantitative method(MTP) and 91.6%. By the qualitative approach, we can conclude that there were no significant changes in biofilm values after 48 hours between groups with and without COVID-19 infection. However, there was a significant difference in adherence levels of bacteria between COVID-19 groups, with a higher proportion of solid adherence in the COVID-19 group compared to moderate adherence in the COVID-19-free group patients.

Both neuroligins and beta-neurexins have alternatively spliced inserts in their extracellular domains. Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we determined that the extracellular domains of the neuroligins sediment as dimers, whereas the extracellular domains of the beta-neurexins appear monomeric. Sedimentation velocity experiments of titrated stoichiometry ratios of beta-neurexin and neuroligin suggested a 2:2 complex formation. The recognition properties of individual neuroligins toward beta-neurexin-1 (NX1beta), along with the influence of their splice inserts, were explored by surface plasmon resonance and affinity chromatography. Different neuroligins display a range of NX1beta affinities spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude. Whereas splice insert 4 in beta-neurexin appears to act only as a modulator of the neuroligin/beta-neurexin association, splice insert B in neuroligin-1 (NL1) is the key element regulating the NL1/NX1beta binding. Our data indicate that gene selection, mRNA splicing, and post-translational modifications combine to give rise to a controlled neuroligin recognition code with a rank ordering of affinities for particular neurexins that is conserved for the neuroligins across mammalian species.""}"

Together with their cellular receptor proteins, cyclophilin (CyP) and FK506-binding protein (FKBP), however, these inhibitors have been shown to have a homogeneous conformation. The existence of a slow cis-trans interconversion of an imidic bond in the inhibitor molecule during the course of the formation of the CsA-CyP18cy complex (where CyP18cy is human 18 kDa cytosolic CyP) prompted us to investigate the reaction of the peptidomacrolides FK506, ascomycin and rapamycin with two specific binding-proteins in more detail. Since formation of the FK506-FKBP complex results in the inhibition of the peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase activity of the binding protein, we used the enzyme's decrease in enzymic activity to monitor binding of the inhibitors to their enzyme targets. For FK506, the kinetics of inhibition of human 12 kDa cytosolic FKBP (FKBP12cy) were clearly dependent on time. Subsequent to a rapid inactivation reaction, not resolved in its kinetics due to manual mixing, a slow dominant first-order inactivation process with a relaxation time of 1163 s at 10 degrees C was observed. Concomitantly the Ki value of the slow phase dropped 2.6-fold within the first 60 min of incubation. Using the FKBP12cy homologue 25 kDa membrane FKBP (FKBP25mem), a bacterial peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase, the rate and amplitudes of the inhibition reactions were very similar to FKBP12cy. On the other hand, the kinetics and amplitudes of the inhibition of FKBP12cy varied significantly if rapamycin was used as an inhibitor instead of FK 506. Owing to reduced conformation transition in rapamycin upon binding to FKBP12cy, the slow phase during inhibition was significantly decreased in amplitude. A likely reason for this became apparent when the activation-enthalpy and the pH-dependence of the rate constants of the slow phase were determined. We conclude that the cis to trans interconversion of the pipecolinyl bond of the three peptidomacrolides may be responsible for the slow process. There was no indication of a suicide catalysis of this process by FKBPs.""}"

Approach: Examine the effects of variations in boiling temperature and boiling time on the antioxidant activity of the boiling extract of Plecranthus amboinicus Lour. Fresh plants were boiled at 45, 60, 100 and 120°C for 1, 2 and 3 h respectively. The decoction was then filtered and the antioxidant activities of the extracted samples were measured on the basis of the scavenging activity of the stable 1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. Results: The antioxidant activity increased with the rise of temperature from 45-100°C but dropped when the extraction temperature was raised to 120°C. Two hours boiling time gave the highest antioxidant activities, but with no significant difference compared to 1 h boiling time (p>0.05). However, 3 h of boiling gave significantly (p<0.05) less antioxidant activity in the extract. Conclusion: Knowing the best boiling temperature and time will guide the future research in preserving antioxidant content of the plant when processing by boiling.""}"

Comprehensive investigations at different temperatures reveal that the newly developed TPI-1 exhibits a better reduction in friction and wear rate below 100 °C, but all of them increase significantly when the bulk temperature exceeds 250 °C. The wear mechanisms demonstrated that sandwich-like tribofilms with different layers were established at different temperatures, which was further verified by characterization of scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Considering the high-performance TPI coupled with Ag-Mo hybrids, we anticipate that further exploration would provide guidance for designing TPI tribo-materials that would be used at high temperatures.""}"

Hand-textured and laboratory-analyzed legacy particle size fraction (PSF) data were obtained from the NRCS National Soil Information System (NASIS). Four models examined various training dataset combinations of new and legacy data. Three PSF sub-models and maps were created for clay, silt, and sand for each parent model. The PSF maps were converted to a soil texture classification map using SAGA 7.4.0 and compared against the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). A set of 320 covariates were provided to Cubist, a machine learning algorithm, to make the data combination models. Twenty-seven rasters were developed to capture eolian sediment transport distribution across the study area. A detailed methodology and case study was used to determine the utility of these rasters as predictors for surface silt content across the Iowan Erosion Surface. The case study showed that the eolian sediment transport distribution rasters were frequently selected by Cubist, but resulted in a higher RMSE and a lower Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) during independent map validation than the model that excluded those covariates. Streaking artifacts present in the directional distance rasters suggest that methodological refinement is needed. At the PSF level, maps that included legacy data as a supplement to the new dataset returned lower RMSE and higher CCC statistics during independent validation. Similarly, the confusion matrices of the soil texture class maps showed that the combined new and legacy data maps outperformed maps trained exclusively with new data. The new data map correctly predicted soil texture class with 27% accuracy, while the maps with new and legacy data had correct classification between 39% and 42%. The results suggest that incorporating new and legacy data is an effective approach for predicting soil texture class. However, the SSURGO soil texture class map outperformed all new and legacy data combination maps with a classification accuracy of 58%.""}"

In a panel spanning the period from 1994 to 2010 and including up to 519 manufacturing sectors, import price changes of Chinese goods pass into U.S. producer prices at an average rate of 0.7, while import price changes that can be traced back to exchange rate movements of other trade partners only have mild effects on U.S. prices. Further analysis points to the importance of trade integration, variable markups, and demand complementarities on the one side, and to the importance of imported intermediate goods on the other side as drivers of these patterns.

We model this phenomenon by considering the magnetization hysteresis with shape-induced demagnetization effect. The self-biased response was found to be directly related to the nature of magnetization and can be tuned by variation in demagnetization state and the resultant differential magnetic flux distribution. These results present significant advancement toward development of AC magnetic field sensor and magnetoelectric composite based on-chip devices by eliminating the need for DC bias.""}"

The purpose of these modules is to address two issues in undergraduate engineering education, retention and nanotechnology education. Over the last decade, there have been a plethora of initiatives focused on formal, and informal, K-12 nanotechnology education. A growing amount of high quality content is available through multiple online resources including NISEnet.org. However, there is often a large gap in nanotechnology education opportunities between high school and senior/graduate level electives. Engineering freshman, a growing number of whom have developed a high degree of interest in the potential of nanotechnology, must wait until graduate school or, if they are lucky, senior level elective classes to obtain any further nanotechnology education. A few schools offer undergraduate nanotechnology degrees or specializations, but at many schools (including our own) much of the emphasis on nanotechnology has been in the form of academic research and electives for seniors and graduate students. In fact, a visual representation of courses available on NanoHub.org shows the vast majority are targeted at the junior level or above. Research indicates that a change in public perception of the role of engineers in society is required to facilitate the recruitment and retention of students to the profession. To that end NAE developed Engineering Messages to help “rebrand” the engineering profession. In 2008, the NAE launched the Engineering Grand Challenges website including fourteen grand challenges that highlight key challenges facing modern society. These Grand Challenges reinforce the engineering messages of how engineers and their creative problem solving skills are essential to improving our world and shaping the future. Despite efforts to recruit more students to the engineering profession many school see a dramatic attrition rate between freshman and sophomore years. Connecting students’ interests in nanotechnology to their first-year engineering courses and the Grand Challenges was therefore seen as an important strategy to promote nanoliteracy and engineering retention. Each module includes: 1) an introduction to the Grand Challenges in general (may not be included if multiple modules used in semester), 2) a discussion of the ‘current state of the art’ for a specific Grand Challenge and needs for addressing the challenge, 3) a knowledge-centered introduction to potential nanotechnology enabled solutions, and 4) hand-on activities for use with the three previous sections. The initial modules focusing on the Grand Challenges “Make Solar Energy Economical” and “Reverse Engineer the Brain” have been developed and used in summer camps for entering freshman and as part of the Chemical Engineering Freshman Engineering course. Initial assessment of effects of the module on nanotechnology knowledge gains, broader engineering and Grand Challenges knowledge gains, and increased commitment to and engagement in engineering will be discussed.""}"

The identification of methods and techniques for presenting events, building event chains that form the main storylines, allows us to assess the originality and effectiveness of the narrative strategy and tactics used by the author. The question of the formation of the “texture” and the rhythm of the narrative is considered in the context of the actual problem of the “narrative model”, characteristic of emigrant authors who reflect their own difficult existential experience in their works, in particular, in comparison with the novel “The Return of the Buddha” by G. Gazdanov. The results obtained during the analysis of the text allow us to talk about the “crisis” narrative model that shapes the world of the story of the hero of the novel “Homo Sovieticus”.""}"

Application Protocols (APs) of STEP support the exchange of product data among different application domains such as CAD, CAE, CAPP, CAM. Therefore, in CE, there is a strong demand for in teroperability between different APs through standardized exchange and shanng of data. This article introduces a systematic approach to implementing the interoperation between APs, which addresses the issue at three levels: Application Interpreted Constructs (AICs), Unit of Functionality (UoFs) and Concept. This paper describes the methodology and illustrates an example of interoperation between AP 203 and AP209 of STEP to demonstrate how to implement the interoperation at the above three levels.""}"

Eleven measurements made for each individual were size-standardized by allometric methods and the resulting measurements were analyzed by cluster analysis and canonical variate analysis (CVA). Randomization tests were used to test the morphometric variation between groups derived from cluster analysis and CVA. The results of cluster analysis and CVA indicated that the six samples were clustered into three groups: the first group included the NECS-02 sample; the second included the Tamsui-10 and Taichung-11 samples; and the third included the Taichung-02, Putai-02 and Cheding-02 samples. Randomization tests showed that morphometric differences among the three groups were significant. Animals with the same morphometric measurements are often assumed to constitute a stock, so there appear to be at least three morphologically distinguishable stocks of this species in the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait.

This paper’s meditation on Fanon and his theorising of the anti-colonial struggle as a peasant revolution is divided into two sections. I will first sketch out the background of colonial Algeria and the nature of anti-colonial liberation in the Third World in the middle of the twentieth century. The second section will discuss Fanon’s conception of revolution in which the peasantry, alongside the “illegalist militants,” initiate a wave of mobilisation that begins in the countryside and embraces the colonised centre of the towns.""}"
