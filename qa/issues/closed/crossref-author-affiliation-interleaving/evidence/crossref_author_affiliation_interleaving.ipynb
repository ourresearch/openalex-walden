Some publishers have **90%+ of their output affected**\n\n### Detection Improvements Made\n\nThe original detection (870k records) was expanded to catch:\n- Institution keywords in **both** `given` AND `family` fields (+182k)\n- Non-English institution keywords (+54k)\n- Corporate/organization patterns (+281k)\n- Additional keywords like Clinic, Medical, Research (+35k)\n- Single-author records (changed `size(authors) >= 2` to `>= 1`)\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Implement detection in the ingestion pipeline\n2. Either:\n   - Filter out institution-like \"authors\" from affected records, OR\n   - Flag records for manual review, OR\n   - Apply publisher-specific fixes\n3. Consider contacting top offending publishers about their metadata formatting"
