    "# Topics Re-run: Works That Gained Abstracts\n",
    "\n",
    "~7.3M works recently gained abstracts (via ox-jobs). These works already had topics computed from title-only\n",
    "(stored in `work_topics_frontfill`). We need to re-run topic inference with the new abstracts for better classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifies works where `work_topics_lm_output.abstract` was NULL/empty at inference time, but `openalex_works_base.abstract` is now >= 30 chars\n",
    "2. Stores their IDs in a tracking table (`topics_rerun_gained_abstracts`)\n",
    "3. Deletes them from `work_topics_lm_output` and `work_topics_frontfill` so the regular pipeline re-processes them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Post-notebook steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the `Topics_Frontfill` job (or wait for E2E) — processes ~3.84M per run\n",
    "2. Will need ~2 runs to cover all ~7.3M\n",
    "3. Works temporarily lose topics between deletion and re-processing (max ~24hrs per E2E cycle)"
